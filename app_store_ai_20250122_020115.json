These companies keep ruining their products because they’ve told themselves that users want inferior products as long as they use AI.  AI is a waste of resources.  And every Canva design I’ve seen using it has been as bad as I expected.  Stick to what made the app great & stop clout chasing.",

I should not have to update my ENTIRE PHONE in Order to have access to the app; which we actually are giving them the rights & access to our entire personal account, information, phone pics, email, passwords, etc. I will just uninstall this app. And use another one!

Wrong. All I wanted to do was upload a photo from my camera roll and I can see it in my gallery, but when I go to Canva, it doesn’t even appear as a choice. Fine let’s try a different photo… select camera roll and upload that photo, says that it is uploading and nothing happens and it goes back to the home page. 🧐 Try something different. That’s just two examples in the 20 minutes I was trying before I gave up. Then it asked me for a review. Now I’m here 🙃 Will be deleting this app.",

I asked it factual questions about a particularly well known athlete. It gave a very detailed and convincing response that was straight up false. I corrected it and it replied “you’re absolutely correct. Sorry about that.” Then it went on to “correct” the mistake by giving another factually false response. Also it often gets very basic math questions incorrect. But it has helped me map out some very useful plans for my business, plans for my fitness (personalized Meal and workout programs), as well as some financials plans. All in all, a great tool but for the user sure needs to double check its work.",

There needs to be a tab for adults only simple 21 and up it up just created it if we gotta pay for it, I’d pay for it a grown man on this app shouldn’t have to be restricted or censored my writing is going down just because I stop using it for three months I come back and now mostly anything that I’m trying to generate does follow guidelines stop catering to younger audiences.",

You should be ashamed and embarrassed, id sue but you make us sign our rights away to even use it. What a weird way to indoctrinate people so gross, are yall using mien komf as a referendum?",

        "內容": "It keeps asking me to rate, so here I am.\n\nShort version:\nExtremely lacking compared to Photoshop; Many, downright essential tools are completely missing, the project and layer management is very obtuse and asinine, and overall the app heavily caters to mobile amateur photographers (think Instagram selfie taker) while neglecting non-standard, non-photography use cases. Overall, I think it is misleading to even have Photoshop in the name, as that implies it shares a connection to Photoshop in any way, which is not the case. \n\nLong Version:\nObviously compared to desktop Photoshop this app pales. Though, to start on the positive side, they have actually managed to fit a lot of features into this mobile app, especially if you are focused on quick and easy photograph editing. I think this app is meant for the Instagram selfie takers, so i'm already not in their target market. However, it is missing a LOT of very basic features when compared to desktop photoshop. I already hear your thoughts: \"Of course it is lacking features compared to desktop photoshop, this is on a mobile phone!\" and I understand this point, however, I would consider the features that it lacks to be extremely basic features that pretty much make this worthless for nearly anything that isn't editing Instagram selfies. I will list a few below.\n\nFirstly, HERE ARE NO SELECTIONS AT ALL. No marquee tool, no lasso, nothing. Hidden under \"Combine\" > \"Cutout\" is a masking tool. Yes, MASKING tool. You can \"Cutout\" what the AI detects as objects or \"Add\" and \"Remove\". It never explicitly states what you are adding and removing, but I'll tell you, it's a layer mask. It's styled as a selection with the marching ants, but nope, layer mask. That means you can't simply select an area of your image and apply edits to the selection only, you have to duplicate your image and then apply a mask to the part you want \"selected\". Speaking of application, there is no marquee tool, rectangle tool, lasso tool, or free draw tool under the cutout section, there is only \"Smartcut\" (magic wand tool) and brush. Smartcut selection actually did pretty well in my use cases, but I don't see a reason why a marquee selection isn't an option. Smartcut already draws a rectangular selection before object detection, but whatever. The brush tool will have to do, assuming weird masking lines isn't an issue for you. I also thought that there was no way to transform your \"selection\"/layers, of course there's no transforming a selection, but to transform a layer you need to go out of the tool that looks like a selection and into another tool, it won't let you drag or pinch while in \"Cutout\". However, calling it transform is... optimistic at best, it's more like a 'move and scale' tool. You can only change the scale and position of the layer, oh, and flip it, but that's it. You are locked to the aspect ratio of the original layer, trying to change it only changes the canvas aspect ratio. Now, your natural instinct may be to crop, export, then import the cropped image into your original project, not an option here. Why not? USING CUTOUT DISABLES MOST EDIT OPTIONS. Including most image manipulation and retouching options. As well as crop. Why? Because using the cutout tool converts your project into a \"mix\" project rather than an \"edit\" project. Oh, and doing this IS DESTRUCTIVE! It doesn't save a copy before converting to a mix project, and all of your previous edits are baked in with no way of undoing the edits or conversion. In addition, most edits in this \"mix\" mode are destructive if you leave the editor, with the exception of cutout edits. \n\nYes, completely bizarre decisions here by Adobe. I have no idea about the backend of this app so I can't necessarily say that it would be easy or hard to add the \"cutout\" masking in edit mode, but all project types have full layer control and the Lightroom app does this fairly well, so I can't see why not. \n\nIf your goal is to edit a selfie, instagram beach picture, or something similar, then this app is definitely tailored for you! However, if you are expecting, or even hoping that this app is even 1% as capable as Photoshop desktop, then you will be severely disappointed. They should not have even kept the Photoshop name as it is completely misleading, this is a completely separate image retoucher and has nothing to do with \"Photoshop\", save for the option to send to Photoshop, which never worked for me.\n\nEven something as simple as cutting out the middle of a screenshot was overly encumbered in Photoshop Express. I opened the app because I had a screenshot of a text message and wanted to blank and cut a portion of it out, but from the middle. Apple Photos proved difficult to even blank a portion of the image out, yet impossible to cut the middle out. With my only other option being importing the photo to my desktop for a very simple, quick, 2 minute edit, I decided to try this app for the first time. Even finding cutout was hard since all of the retouching features come up first, and I was looking for a selection tool. Anyways, you get into cutout and then you need to manually draw the area you want to cut out. Then, duplicate the image, use the brush to mask top part of the image that you want to move down, click out of the tool and drag the layer down. Oh, and if I forgot to mention it earlier, there's literally NO SNAPPING. None. Anyways, you can't crop at this point because that would give you the finished image and be too easy. Now you need to export the (uncropped) image, just import the exported image back into Express so you can get into edit mode and access the cropping tool. Why isn't there a cropping tool in mix mode? Or better yet, why can't I just rasterize and convert the project from mix to edit mode when you can the other way around? Many of the methods to do things in this app are just very asinine and don’t make sense.",

They were free, but also not as powerful as the original Photoshop, so it balanced out well. Now they’ve discontinued those other two and lumped a few of their features into Express. Express was clearly not made for those features, it was made for edits like text and filters on images. They just don’t quite fit. Express is also much less capable than Fix and Mix. For example, I have not found a way to change the canvas size on Express, but it was quite easy to do that in the other ones. To make it even worse, so many feature are now payed “Premium” features, including basic things like cloning! It’s just pure greed.",

Photoshop Mix was an incredible app that worked for years as the most user friendly, efficient, responsive application that did NOT charge a subscription fee for most basic functions. Using Mix is now impossible because of the greed of adobe. Express is a slow, unresponsive, less user friendly mess of an app that corrals you to the most narrow functions of photo editing without a PAID SUBSCRIPTION. Talk about a middle finger to the user base- if you don’t want to use their bloated, slow, paid app with AI tools no one wants or asked for, too bad! They got rid of your other option that worked, so no you don’t have a choice. Bring back mix, this app is an abomination and an insult.",

        "內容": "I’ve been a loyal user of Meitu for years now, but I’m extremely disappointed with the recent experience I’ve had. I’ve always been logged into my Meitu account, but in January 2025, I was logged out without my knowledge. When I opened the app again, I was hit with a prompt saying I needed to subscribe to use features I already had access to. Without realizing it, I accidentally ended up subscribing again, resulting in me having two active subscriptions.\n\nThe second subscription, which I did not intend to sign up for, is now marked as “Not eligible for refund” despite the fact that it was an accidental charge due to the system logging me out. Apple support chat was also unable to help me. I’ve always been a paying customer, and this situation feels like a technical glitch that is being unfairly penalized. It’s incredibly frustrating to be out the equivalent of seven months of subscription fees for something I wasn’t aware I had to be vigilant of. \n\nPlease improve your login system and refund policy to prevent this from happening to other users. It’s hard to feel loyal to an app that causes this kind of unnecessary hassle.",

But the problem is that I used to be able to use it 6x (or more) times a day. Now it’s been reduced to 1x a day, if you have pro/premium. This is very upsetting for me because I am an editor and I desire to make multiple edits a day, but with this one singular use of HD quality I have, I can’t post edits very often or else it will look bad. Another problem is that I simply can’t open the app, it automatically kicks me out. Now I have to result to redownloading the app every time I use it so i’m able to enter the app. I’ve tried shutting down my device and turning the wifi back on but it still kicks me out.",

You are absolutely awesome for that - best customer support experience - (plz do it on web version as well I will be eternally grateful ) \n\nAnother idea -> if I could have a mind map like obsidian notes except better and it works as a notion mind map for all my subpages - If I could open one note project page and have a mind map displaying all the correlated concepts that could be tagged / color coded \n\nI could organize and see the hundreds of stacks in some kind of infinite canvas mind map which helps see everything in a way which helps connect the dots via all the tags with different colors on different notes - even a search feature embedded on the mind map that focuses on the correlated thought chains / tagged blocks \n\n - If you implemented this I would be eternally grateful 🙏\n\nThank you - I love your whole team 🚀",

When I tried to add this on the website, it says I can’t add it because I subscribed via the app. \n\nWhen you google this issue, you will find that people have complained about this with no resolution for over 18 months. \n\nThe current workaround is canceling the iOS subscription, waiting for the month or year to expire (or some sketchy refund tactics), and then subscribing online. I don’t understand what decision makers decided that is acceptable. I can only assume incompetence since it’s literally counterproductive to the profitability, but that incompetence makes me apprehensive to use the platform, as my data in Notion is proprietary, so if the poor execution is systemic, it could be potentially harmful.",

However, I can’t use my phone while I’m letting it back up.\n\nOverall pretty good app and hoping to save some storage with it (although just having the app is filling up my storage EVEN MORE [currently 700 MB which is my largest app]) but it is nuanced and requires some “working with what is given”.",

        "內容": "Photogrid is a really good app! I’ve been using it for years. I’d be happy to watch an ad or two before I edit a photo. \n\nBut instead…. anytime you test a new font, or do anything at all to the photo you have to watch an ad! It’s so excessive. To just TRY a font it’s a 15-30 second ad. Absolutely disgusting. They don’t even have this many ads on F2P games. Click any button at all and an ad pops up. \n\nAny reviewer who complains about this gets the same copy/paste response that ads are necessary to run the service. In reality, they’ve done this intentionally so you get so frustrated by the interruptions you just pay to remove ads (vs watching 1-2 ads prior to editing). Not going to give a company like that money.",

As other Reviewers mention, there are so many bugs, drop-downs that disappear, reduced functionality, it only can be used in landscape mode, useless pop-ups that take up the entire work screen, and repeated crashing while working. There was a period where I could not access any fonts, because the drop-down only showed a sliver of the name of each font, Meaning, I could barely see what I was scrolling to find. At another point, I used the blending tool and wanted to revert to another effect in the drop-down screen which showed a ghost of a screen, then disappeared and I was unable to fix the layer. What’s most upsetting is that I worked on a post that I wanted to turn into a flyer and the resize feature would not stop sending error codes. I contacted support- their name was Mushafiq, and they told me to use Chrome. Chrome just has a landing page that takes you back to the app. I sent them a screenshot and they ended the chat with no further comment or resolution. I’m tired of wasting my time and energy on this Adobe product and will be finding an alternative ASAP.",

I’m talking 4 hours for a picture of a dog, a poem & some paw prints. Horrible. The collages would not print without margins & all the pictures came out super light. To top it off, I thought my free trial ending 12/8 meant I could cancel on 12/9 but was wrong & was charged $39.99 which is a complete rip off. Especially since most of the options are “vip.” You charged me $39.99 for an app that can’t even spell yearly right & have the nerve to have a plan that costs more than that?? Of course Apple will not refund because that’s what Apple does so I’ll file a complaint with the FTC for this & all the charges they refuse to refund for my minor children over the years & hope that there will be another lawsuit against them some day. There is nothing about this app that is worth $39.99 & if you want to try it, be mindful of the date the free trial ends because you will be charged.",

Introduction of a subscription based service that locks the free version behind ads which weren’t there before is a slap in the face tbh. I’m unsure if they made any sort of announcement about their roadmap and the paywalls they wanted to implement to the core of the app, but the change feels fairly jarring and drastic and I will no longer recommend it. I would absolutely understand a one-time purchase (much like procreate) to support the developers, but a subscription to a non-essential app (who’s now made their free version considerably worse) I can’t bring myself to support.",

I wouldn't have minded paying a dollar or two for the app, but I resent the idea of monthly payment as this makes it possible for developers to change the price whenever they want; if you didn't catch their notification, they could essentially start withdrawing much higher amount from your bank every month without you realizing.

I had to delete the app until they return back to earth. (Sad day). Here we are in 2025 and the premium just went up again!! To $11.99. That’s ridiculous!! Farewell!",

My favorite team lost. The reason I got the notification in the first place because I put it as my favorite team. Now Google knows DANG WELL THAT IF I HAVE THAT AS MY FAVORITE TEAM IM GOING TO BE WATCHING THE GAME. And this isn’t the first time it’s happened. This has happened COUNTLESS TIMES.

It rarely attains a length of 12 feet in length  although ,  15’ is  a possibility .  Python m molurus was called the Light Phase and the Burmese Python was called the dark phase Indian Python.  Another sub species , Python m pimbura, from Sir Lanka -previously the island nation of Ceylon, is almost identicacl to the Python m molurus.  Difference is in length and girth, where pimbura is brighter in color, more defind in colour of pattern on skin, with the head being more reddish in nature.  I believe that this snake-once thought to be a separate species will soon be included in being the same species.",

Every time I try to log into Pinterest or any other app I have to verify despite the fact I already did and I’m already logged in on Google. Why do I have to do more verification steps?

        "內容": "SCAM!!!!! I downloaded the app and selected the free 7-day trial. It said I would get 30 free credits and did not get them. I was going to use the app for hair AI which said it requires no credits. So I got into the hair AI and guess what?! You need credits. Two lies so far. So I went to cancel it right away because it did not have the feature I wanted at a reasonable price (credits are separate from the member ship and not only are they required for EVERYTHING you do, but they are EXPENSIVE) and you do not get many). Apparently they charge you through a third party in which I do not have an account. It does not show up under Apple subscriptions due to this third party and there is no way to cancel through the app directly. I have since seen past reviews that say the same thing, with some people going into their third year being charged after they have attempted to contact the company multiple times. Looks like it is time for an attorney because it is misleading and against the law to say that it is free and you can cancel anytime, yet they provide no way to do that. I have screen shot every interaction I have had with this app and they will be sued if they touch my bank account. Bottom line, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!",

Subtlety? Apparently, that’s not in this app’s vocabulary.\n\nThe AI is laughable—it can’t detect facial features correctly half the time, leaving you with warped eyes or a smudged jawline that looks like a bad sci-fi effect. And don’t even get me started on the constant pop-ups pushing overpriced subscriptions. Why would I pay for an app that turns every photo into a cartoonish disaster?\n\nOn top of that, the app is slow, bloated, and crashes more often than not. You’d think with all the money they rake in, they’d invest in basic functionality. Bottom line: avoid this app unless you enjoy frustration and fake-looking selfies.",

        "內容": "“HOLDING the reservation” is the point, as Seinfeld said. Similarly, buying a subscription is easy, but USING the subscription requires BUYING THE TOOLS TO USE IT — while USING it is the point... \n\nUnfortunately, such “scams” (as another user pointed out)—perhaps especially with Microsoft and Adobe, the latter of which has been honing their system for the past decade—indicate a burgeoning wave of such “subscriptions” and other fees to “use” (piecemeal parts of) apps (and games) that we’ve already bought, without any features, leaving the “subscriber” to buy add-ons in or to use the app/subscription.\n\nHowever, WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT—as with gambling boxes and leasing ready-made DLC (sometimes already on the Ubisoft disc you’d bought, which means you’re leasing second key to the content you’ve already bought but don’t have the right to use)—“MONETIZATION STRUCTURES” like this (PR-speak for “how to use psychological insights to chip ever more money from consumers”) SIMPLY CAN’T MAKE IT. SO, if you’d not like to help make such bait-and-switch tactics the order of the day, *don’t give the people who would use it to do so the money to make it happen.*\n\nMeantime, I’ll be happy to feedback about opening performance and interface if the developer agrees to buy it from before having any idea what I’m charging or how much I have to say about it. Doing so might raise the score, as a function of my score for how much I may have liked those parts, averaged in with my review, so far, about the way it’s sold...",

When we came back to pick up the bags, the house was locked with our bags in it and the host who was in the US, called me and in a rude, offensive manner claimed that we stole his small tv and a fan from the ceiling. A nonsense. We called AirBnb and asked them what we should do. After waiting a couple of ours in front of the house we entered it from the back, the house keeper left the back door open, likely intentionally. We got our bags, noticed missing bottle of Moet, sunglasses. When we called the host and explained that all the things were in place, he started asking for an extra day payment as we entered his house. He again was using offensive words.\nAfter I explained everything to airbnb and provided pictures, they reviewed the case within 2-3 days. After which they blocked my account 😊\nCrazy story on my wedding day. I do not wish anyone such experience.",

Unfortunately I had two extra guests that wanted to attend as well so I asked the host if she could accommodate, which she could not. That was no problem so I decided to cancel and get a bigger Airbnb to fix the problem. For starters, they only gave me a partial refund so kept almost $300 from me when trying to get a new Airbnb. Then they only have options for a refund, either wait 15 business days to get a refund or keep the money in the account and use it right away so I decided to do that so I could book an Airbnb as soon as possible since my trip was in a week away. When I tried to do so I kept getting an error message saying I’m suspected of throwing a party. Which I am 100% not I just have a large larger group of people. Our intentions were to hot tub and go sledding, Nothing more. No matter how many times I tried I would always get this error message so I decided to call Airbnb. When I did so not only did they tell me my account would be blocked from being able to get an Airbnb for a month, they also told me they wouldn’t be able to transfer my $400 to me and it would be stuck in an app that I can’t use. They also said it’s an automated thing and happens all the time so beware if you’re trying to book something in a rush you could be banned for a month randomly. Their attempt to remedy the problem was that I could use my $400 stuck in the account to get a hotel room. What hotel room would fit 10 people? So they won’t give me my money back and they won’t give me the Airbnb. Absolutely horrible customer service do not recommend.",

Supply and demand. \n\nThis is one of my grievances with Airbnb and the host. In our last stay; the host continued to watch us through the ring doorbell. Likewise, after we booked that house; she posted a two-page rule book of; “Don't do this or that. “ She continued to state that this was their house and guests would be charged an astronomical amount of money should we break anything. It was like staying at your grandparent's house in the 80s that had plastic on everything.  \n\nI can go on and on - the host needs to disclose everything before accepting a request to stay. \n\nRespectfully, \n\nStaying at a hotel rather than staying at an Airbnb",

        "內容": "I stayed at a place for 6 nights and everything was going just fine. Until the host submitted a reimbursement request. She claimed I had inflicted damages to things that i am not responsible for at all. After days and weeks dodgy phone calls with support on the issue. They told me that Air bnb will automatically WITHDRAW $729 out of my account. This to me is absolutely criminal and is a total ROBBERY. This is how Airbnb treats repeat customers. It’s just another company run by corporate greed.",

Upon arrival I quickly realized it was not remotely close to what was advertised. I left 15 minutes later. Being the busy person I am, I never got around to review the property and the host. I didn’t get a refund which I had no problem with but they wanted to charge me extra for supposed “damage fees” claiming I had smoked in the property. The host left a review that doesn’t speak well of me and they refuse to remove it or investigate it. For that reason I am done with this service.",

My wife and I later found out the property clearly didn’t allow any forms of Airbnb via onsite property managers but Airbnb support team treated me like it’s none of their business after multiple attempts asking for termination of our stay.   We were so close to press legal action on this particular case.  However, we found out Airbnb granted their host all the power in determination of the situation vs. consumers were left in the open to be slaughtered.Thanks for ruining my trip and overall impression of another country Airbnb. Absolutely 100% churned from the platform and would encourage anyone else who is planning to use the service to exhaust all other options before proceeding.",

I also cried to the host to give me a refund or let me change to there other rentals.  They said no at first. Then said it would be an EXTRA $2,400 on top of the $2,200 I Already Paid!! \nIt was a Horrible experience.  Air bnb has lost a lot of my future business.  Thanks for the no help. A holes.",

But I do have some suggestions and some things I would like to share! I would like to start by saying I don’t like how you have to pay to save your picture now! That’s unfair to all the clients that have been free-saving their pictures for as long as B612 has been an app! Well that is just a suggestion that you drop the prices out, that will make this app the latest trend! Otherwise this app is really incredible thanks!",

Photos are pixelated and blurry with really low resolution like it was taken from a 2013-2016 over filtered phone camera. It won’t focus or the camera filter/effect “snaps” on randomly. It use to not be like this at all. The quality has severely gone down and I have had my last straw.",

The platform’s repeated scandals—ranging from Cambridge Analytica to hidden tracking—prove they don’t value user trust.\n\nIf you care about unbiased information and data privacy, steer clear.

Here's what happened to me:\nI had TanTan installed for about a month. While I received messages from multiple supposed female users, they all seemed suspicious, and I never responded. The real issue emerged when I discovered the app was tracking my location in 'Always' mode without my conscious consent.\nYesterday, while driving on Highway 1 in San Francisco, I received an SMS claiming to be about toll charges. The link looked legitimate, but it was actually a phishing scam from a Philippines number (+63). Within minutes of entering my card details, I had to freeze my card.\nAfter investigating how scammers knew my exact location, I found that TanTan was the only app set to 'Always' share my location. This level of location tracking was likely used to enable targeted scams.\nThe app appears to be of Chinese origin and shows clear signs of being part of a sophisticated fraud operation. It's not just a dating app - it's a security threat that can compromise your location data and financial information.\nDO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. If you have it installed, remove it immediately and check your location sharing settings. Your privacy and financial security are at risk.",

Not a real woman picture. I would stay 100% away from this app. It has five stars and so many reviews unless the reviews aren’t real either.

But ultimately, this is supposed to be a dating app, not just a place to make friends.\n\nI purchased a three-month subscription for about $15, expecting better results. However, I later realized that sending more “super crushes” or unlocking additional features costs $10 a month extra—meaning I ended up paying $30 for three months. Even then, I discovered there’s a more expensive tier, costing $800 a year, just to message the most popular profiles. That’s an entirely separate cost on top of changing search settings or sending more crushes.\n\nThe pricing structure feels misleading because it’s not clear what each subscription level includes. On top of that, many profiles seem fake or inactive, yet they’re still liking profiles to generate activity. I used this app seven years ago when it was simpler, but it’s definitely shifted toward being more of a social platform than a dating app. I wish I’d done more research before subscribing. It’s not just the high price—it’s the confusing benefits and questionable profiles that make me feel like I’ve been scammed.\n\nWith my 500 count, I was not counting scammers which are abundant on this app. The way to notice if they are a scammer is, if they talk about living in Texas, on a trip to London, ask for personal information and (photos, first and last names, age, and your real location), also they discuss cryptocurrency and own luxury brands or something.",

Not a very good one, however, they never had the nerve to try and ask one of their consumers for dime. \nReally disappointing that theirs so many selfish awful businesses in this day and age.

Finally in 2025, I decided to download this app because I was informed it had a feature that acted like their MB player. Come to find out, it isn’t in there. It even tracked my playlists from my account and yet, there is no feature to be found where I can access and play. Maybe they put the feature behind the paywall but I ain’t spending money on an AI app. They either put the feature in there somehow someway without any hassle nor payment OR put back up their music player app because forcing their users into using AI app for the so called good ain’t really good at all.",

        "內容": "I gave it a solid try both online and in the app. Both experiences were pretty brutal and several times the AI informed he runs on 3.5 and not 4. \n\nUnfortunately GPT4 is the big push in MixerBoxer’s promotion of the app. It’s the first thing you see when you ask the AI for a comparison with OpenAi. I know you can “regenerate answer with GPT4” but who wants to resort to that on Day 1.\n\nThey also promote it as unlike OpenAi, it runs with built-in features like weather and browse. **Again, untrue; to use those tools you have to click and enable the function. Which is pretty much the same as enabling plugins on OpenAi.\n\nImage gen was very bad.\nBrowse worked only once.\n\nSorry, I really wanted to like this because of the relative success of MixerBoxer’s plugins. Just isn’t a good product yet.",

        "內容": "I’ve been using Papago for about four years. In the beginning there were significant issues with translation (I’m using for both Korean and Japanese). The issues were particularly with Korean. Being new to Hangul, I didn’t understand the sentence structure and the app didn’t work well with helping to understand that aspect. With the help of other sources I was finally able to figure out, for the most part, how to put together sentences and phrases. It still translates some words and sentences awkwardly and differently than other translation apps. I’m actually still trying to figure some of those out. In certain cases I just go with what the majority of the other apps say. But I’m writing a review today for one very important (to me at least) that seems to not be working as well as previously. I think it’s very important especially to foreigners and those who are younger who are using this app. There is an “honorific” option when translating. Recently, I’ve noticed it’s not working as it has in the past. I’m not saying it just gives outright casual translation, but it certainly doesn’t provide the ”니다“ ending like it used to. I understand not everything ends with “니다” , but it seems like there’s more of the “요“ ending instead. This is just my personal opinion, but if I’m speaking to someone who I don’t know and who is older than me I would rather use the more formal ending. Please take these suggestions into consideration. 감사합니다.",

Recently, the video feature started defaulting to portrait mode and you have to rotate your device several times to force it back to horizontal. I’d like to see a preference that just locks horizontal mode. The audio (speech) feature really doesn’t work most of the time. As with all translation programs, I wish there was a preference to translate into English without altering the syntax. For example, if the foreign language text literally reads, “Bathroom, where is it at?” I’d like to be able to see the translation that way rather than, “Where is the Bathroom?” It’s much easier to learn a foreign language if you learn to think in the native syntax.",

        "內容": "This app is truly incredible once you take time to explore what it can do and use creative thinking. I made the mistake for a while of avoiding functions that i didn’t understand by their name alone but once i began learning what each thing is the whole experience really opened up and it’s great. The wait times are not bad at all, seconds basically, compared to many other similar apps that crash and stall or make dozens of ads between every click! This means you can do fairly quick work, especially once you have got the hang of it and can go through a routine of fundamental things you apply. The AI functions are better than any website AI apps i tried. Sometimes you have to try different wordings, the AI seems to understand very literally and you have to re-write it for it to understand what you mean. It seems to learn as you go along, idk if that’s me imagining it but when you “regenerate” it seems like it is thinking “hmm, that wasn’t it, try this?” And so on until you get it. If that is the case then that’s really cool. Also have found that sometimes it might make something, like a foot you are adding, too big proportionate to the body, but if you edit the prompt and write “make it fit proportionately” it will usually get the right one, don’t give up on the first try is what i’m saying. I have genuinely found this app to be very enjoyable and enhancing my art work and the creative process and experience. I’m sorry for never giving a review until now but i feel ready to praise and recommend this app now and i have turned several other people on to it after they were impressed with some of my work. Thank you.",

Audiobook side is nice in that it’s integrated directly into the reading app, but the one feature that will keep me from purchasing any future audio books (especially nonfiction) is the inability to bookmark a section you want to come back to. I assumed this was a given at this point in any audiobook app so I bought a few books, heard a section I wanted to bookmark, realized bookmarks didn’t exist, and now wish I’d bought them on kindle. It looks like this feature has been requested on the apple forums for years but has yet to be added.",
