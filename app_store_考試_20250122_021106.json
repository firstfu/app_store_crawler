All the features that you could pay for don’t really prevent you from having a good experience either. And after reading the story behind the app it all makes me appreciate it even more!!! This’ll always be an app that I recommend to my friends. It’s so fun seeing the statistics on it as well, seeing how much time I spend doing what, it makes it feel worth it. Also you’re able to customize your traveler which is so cute! Everything is cut and dry and simple which makes tinkering with the app when bored pretty much impossible. Again, I absolutely love this app and I think it’s amazing for all ages, especially students in need of some uninterrupted study sessions! Lots of love to this app and its creators, I hope to find more of their creations soon!",

I love how Spotify or Apple Music can connect to the app and have nature background noise! The graphics and animation are the best, thank you!!\n\nI do want to ask if there is a possibility of having a break time as soon as the Focus Timer is complete? I think it would make it more affective! I notice as soon as my timer is complete, I get distracted and forget to restart another timer. Keeping the Focus Timer and Rest Time when exiting the app is great, but having a Rest Time then going back into another Focus Session would be even better!!   \n\nAnd, to have the option of shuffling or picking a specific song out of the given playlists on the Focus Music, I like picking where my playlist will start! Not sure if this is out of your capabilities since it involves another app that is outside FocusTraveller. Yes, I could do it separately in another tab, but it would be so convenient!!\n\nIf read, I appreciate you taking time to view this. I hope my thoughts are taken into consideration. Thank you much!\n\n- Struggling Junior",

                "內容": "I love this app! It keeps me focused and off my phone (in “deep focus“ mode). After a few days, I upgraded to the full subscription, and it's worth it. My favorite feature is that the timer counts up, so I can pause or end a session without losing credit for the focus time I've already put in. This removes the pressure of \"all or nothing\" timers that penalize you, which can be demotivating.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to add some variety to the app's design and soundscapes. For example, the Flora app offers new locations and islands to unlock and explore. Adding something similar to FocusTraveller like mountains, streams, or forests with distinct bird sounds or background animals, could keep users engaged and motivated while also preventing the app from becoming monotonous over time.",

                "內容": "I recently switched to FocusTraveller from the Flora app, which I had used for years. It had become virtually unusable because of its glitches. \n\nI love the intuitive interface of the app, and the graphics are gorgeous. The prompt to take deep breaths are helpful. I love the ability to take breaks and choose your traveler. \n\nIt would be great to see a few valuable features I enjoyed from other productivity apps. \n\n1. Adding a sense of progression to keep it engaging. In other apps, I liked how spending more time on the app allowed you to unlock new features, like growing new plant species or exploring new areas. It made the experience more rewarding and less monotonous. Introducing a similar gamification element here would be a fantastic addition and help keep users motivated- maybe adding different maps to explore or customization for your traveler (like clothes/accessories or a pet that travels with you). \n\n1.5: Special badges- the Flora app not only allowed users to unlock new plant species to grow as they spent more time focusing; they also gifted a badge for every plant that was grown either with a friend or through a paid session (putting money on the line). Seeing those badges was very rewarding, so even when I ran out of plants to unlock, I focused on earning both badges for every plant I had. Visual reinforcement for progression is KEY to keeping users interested in coming back to the app. \n\n2. Allowing users to put money on the line. Flora allowed users to choose a value (between $5-$100) to be charged if they took a break or left the app. This is useful for those who need an extra push to stay focused on their task- it helped me a LOT during finals season.\n\n3. The ability to block distracting apps during the focus session. This adds an extra barrier to simply scrolling on social media while the session is running. I benefitted a LOT from this feature, as I sometimes open distracting apps without even thinking when I get bored. \n\n4. The ability to add friends without Game Center. I very, very frequently studied with friends through the Flora app. It provides an extra layer of accountability. Providing a QR code or a username to add friends through would be convenient. \n\nI have diagnosed ADHD, but these features kept me coming back to the Flora app for a little less than four years. I really love FocusTraveller and would love to see the aforementioned updates. I think they would enhance the experience and keep distracted users engaged and coming back for more. \n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Thanks for reading my review!",

I paid for premium and since then, the Course section audio stops working shortly after starting a lesson. Other areas do have the audio working, just not the course area. I tried restarting, clearing the cache, and all the things they mention in the help section. I even tried Spanish, and the same thing occurs. I can’t do the lessons without audio. I emailed them and I won’t hear from them for 17 days. At that point, I doubt I’ll be able to get a refund. I went from excited to disappointed very quickly. Will update, hopefully this is an easy fixed, but I feel like it’s a coding error.\n\nUPDATE: They have since reached out and fixed the problem. I don’t have any audio issues now and I’ve completed two lessons and all icons now work. Thank you for listening.",

If I highlight a quarter of a sentence or work I don’t get the full meaning at all I have to use a translation app. Nothing appears anymore compared to the older version. Amazing app to work with but becomes 300% harder to do anything because the re-design reflaws out features that aren’t suppose to have issues and bugged out frequently.",

I’ve only had it about three weeks and I’m learning a TON.  So sorry I wasted a year with Mochi Kanji.  I’ve learned a lot more than I have with two years of Duolingo Japanese.  That being said, Duolingo is also good for learning vocabulary, hiragana, katakana, and kanji. But Migii really brings home the explanations and conjugation that Duolingo lacks.  If you do download Migii, please be sure you have the hiragana and katakana down pat.  Knowing kanji is also useful.

Also great for a quick drill session to keep the memory fresh",

                "內容": "I struggle a lot with focusing and motivation for basically everything (probably ADHD lol), and all the other apps I’ve tried like this were kind of meh at best and i only was consistent at studying for a couple days at best. BUT THIS APP IS SO DIFFERENT. Literally i’ve gotten addicted to it inthe first 5 minutes, in a good way! I’d buy the full version right now if i had money to spare, but luckily because the developer is super nice, it’s still super fun (and effective!) on the ad version! \n\nThis uses the most creative way i’ve ever seen someone integrate ads into their app. Basically you get an ad for every 5 mistakes you make, so it’s kind of like a health system in a video game. That helps my motivation to not mess up and instead focus, AND they can make money when i do inevitably mess up! It’s genius!!\n\nNot to mention, the dev is super open about being a one person team and about how ads are annoying but are a necessity to keep it free, so I’m totally on the dev’s side because of the clarity! And the full version is only like $15 for life, so I’d consider that a steal!\n\nAs for some of the content itself, it doesn’t hold your hand with romaji (or rather, it’s a setting I turned off to make it harder on myself and more effective), it cleverly gives you simple yet common words to help learn the kanas, there’s actual audio from an actual person, and there’s clever spaced repetition! Basically everything I want in a language learning app. Solid 5 stars.",

I've received praise that I sound like a Japanese person when I speak. Reason for that is I've reached a point where I can understand the rhythm of the conversation. \n\nOne minor compliant I have and I have asked the staff about this constantly. The compliant is that some of the radio podcasts are not working so could come out with an update that can fix this?\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with the results of my Japanese proficiency by using this application.",

The spaced repetition algorithm in this app is like magic. Also learning the most frequently spoken words is way more useful than learning random nouns and verbs that you’ll probably never use, which seems to be common in other apps. I was hesitant to spend the money but I’m committed to learning foreign languages (Russian,Spanish,mandarin), and I can say it was worth it. I upgraded to the 10 year subscription when they had a promotion. Hopefully they add Mandarin Chinese in the future. If you really want to learn a foreign language, this app really works!",

In the reverse, if you forgot a known word and want to change it’s status back to new or learning, this is not possible. \n\nIt’s support for synonyms seems almost nonexistent. There are many words that can correctly be answered several ways, but it will only accept one answer, and all you can do is remember for that specific prompt, which synonym is correct.",

My issues with it are that 1) it doesn’t support multi-word expressions, which are pretty important, 2) the words aren’t connected to a complete dictionary so you have to leave the app to get a full definition, 3) it’s the same woman’s voice and you get sick of it, also it’s used for masculine words (like she’d say “estoy cansado”, which is confusing—speaking of which, sometimes it gives you no clue whether to use o or a), and 4) it doesn’t distinguish between rare and frequent words, so you learn a lot of rare ones.

                "內容": "Overall I like this app but it has flaws. The app should accept alternative words in the phrases, not insist on me having to learn another word. I already know how to say this. (learning a language is hard enough) Secondly, the voice option capitalizes the first spoken word (when more than one word is needed) and then it doesn’t accept the solution, it wants lower case , then I end up having to type it in by hand. Sort of negates the voice option. Thirdly: Everything is spoken by a robot who really can’t pronounce Italian 100%. It sounds like an alien and according to my Italian teacher the robot actually makes mistakes inflecting some words the wrong way. Recordings of real people would be much better. Also the algorithms throw the words at you that you don’t know, especially within the first 10-20, out of 50.  It would be better to intersperse it more; ask for words we already know, so we can first warm up a little and feel better about ourselves. What’s good: learning words in context, in sentences. It doesn’t look like a stupid videogame. I don’t want virtual trophies and be overly praised for no reason. \n\nIn case any of you Schmucks are actually ever reading this: we should not be rated by including the new word performance! After all, they’re new! Percentages should be based on repeats only. \nBye. Off to find something better.",

                "內容": "Lingvist is hands down the best language learning app out there, and, believe me, I have tried them all (including all of the fully paid versions). I took French in school, but never learned to actually speak the language (despite always getting As). Over the years, I have wanted to fix that and finally learn the language for real, once and for all. I am not exaggerating when I say I have tried ALL the language learning apps out there (and not just the free versions, but the fully paid subscriptions). Many were useless, some were very good, but nothing compares to Lingvist. When I started using Lingvist, MAGIC happened. Suddenly, I was able to read novels (actual novels written for adults) in French, including books that I had purchased years ago but given up on as impossibly difficult, and even watch many movies/TV shows in French (something I had all but forsaken). Lingvist made my vocabulary EXPLODE—and somehow, I just remember the words I learn in Lingvist so much better than through other similar apps. As if that weren’t enough, Lingvist has an amazing feature that lets you create custom decks of words to learn. All you have to do is type in a list of words you want to learn, and Lingvist defines them and creates sentences with them. You can even tell Lingvist to expand on your custom list and find other similar words to add. I have no idea why Lingvist is so much more effective than other similar apps, but it just is. It’s like a magic wand for language acquisition. I feel like I have had pixie dust sprinkled on me.",

This app is still generally very good for language learning, especially if learners also use media for stuff like grammar or practise, and I'd like to see it improve and expand in the future.",

I saw some people talking about how Lingvist is Duolingo for adults. I don’t even understand the comparison because they teach in two completely different ways. I’ve done my fair share of apps to learn languages and I don’t know if any really help in the way they think they do? Clearly it’s just my opinion in how it helps me. \n\nI used it to practice Norwegian and Korean. Focusing solely on my experience with this app, I don’t know if I can say either really helped me with grammar? Both of the languages have nuances in a sense where very similar vocabulary is used but it may be spelled differently or it’s dependent upon the tone of formality used. I will say, I was happy to see that in the Korean lessons, they noted the formality to be used. On the other hand, with both languages, there was no context or formal introduction to the words? I used to like Memrise for this specific reason. You would learn vocabulary and gradually work up to it being used in a sentence. It used to give you the chance to understand context. \n\nLingvist just feels like a list of vocabulary words set in front of you that you have to memorize and it leaves it at that. There aren’t really quizzes or anything to test rapid recall or some way to really gauge it? It’s just either you remember or you don’t. It doesn’t feel all that engaging to me is I guess the way I would sum it up. I’m thankful for the free trial I had because it seems you can’t use a single thing in the app without some form of subscription or free trial active so there’s that. I’m glad there are people getting so much out of it but it just doesn’t seem to have benefited me all that much.",

                "內容": "In ways, Lingvist is Duolingo for grownups—more advanced and without Duolingo’s annoying animations and autogenerated encouragement. And Lingvist does a much better job of targeting the areas where a particular user needs work. But Lingvist has a key shortcoming: it doesn’t help users understand why a particular synonym is correct in a particular context. Why, for instance, is “gleich” rather than “nun” or “jetzt” the right answer for a particular prompt? Occasionally a notification tells the user that the answer isn’t wrong but isn’t the word Lingvist is trying to teach, but even these notifications often don’t appear when they should. And the English translations seem unreliable. For instance, “Ermöglichen” and “sorgen für” are both translated as “ensure”, but “make possible” and “take care to” are probably better translations. And obviously “yield” isn’t the right translation for the past-tense verb “ergab”.  Consequently the user too often must simply learn by rote to provide a particular answer for a particular prompt without knowing why.",

This app however, not only has worked for me, but works so well that it took me from someone who would spend an hour to finish 1 thing of double sided homework, to now 25 minutes to finish double sided homework. That is less then half the time! With the timer plus the purchaseable white noise feature I can now get a lot of work done at a better more reasonable time, all while staying sane too! The app is humorous and old timey in design, it encourages while you work which is very touching, and the white noise options really help the mind focus along with the timer.\nIf you have read this until the end 1. Thank you and 2. Download this app and make the 1.99 in-app purchase! If my work/school life can change for the better simply from the use of this app, so can yours today!!!",

This app not only has functions you can get for ordinary habit-building apps, but they also include other functions usually unavailable on other apps, such as big-days-countdown, setting long-term goals, and collecting achievement cards. There is tomato timer function too, so you can track the time you spend on every habit. The developers really care about user feedbacks and they even build an social media group to collect these feedbacks.",

Some sentences don’t make sense! Which makes it even worse for English learners. I figure that the developers or creators of the app might have to type in the books themselves because I refuse to think that all authors of such books have committed these atrocious grammatical mistakes. \n\nI don’t think the app is worth a $7.99 USD weekly subscription at all.

I’d probably upgrade if I could use it for a few minutes without constant bombardment. \n\nYou need to tweak the gameplay in settings but everyone you enter settings or change one little thing you get a new ad making it impossible to just try some options. The way it’s designed encourages you to tweak gameplay which can lead to 3 ads all within about 20 seconds of trying to play. \n\nNow ad the fact the ads are glitchy. They freeze, and some are so oversized you can’t find the close button. Or the close button is just non responsive making you watch the entire 30 seconds. \n\nActual gameplay: It’s sorta meh. When you get a wrong answer it just sorta glitches to the next one. It works but just feels like a college students project. \n\nThat being said, It’s probably fine but just too much of a mess.",

The game should allow a rotation of the phone (into landscape mode) to show more octaves on the keyboard. Then a C that’s an octave below another C would map to the lower note on the keyboard, not the same key, for example.",

Also, not really an issue, but this game’s advertisement is very similar to Teacher Simulator’s which might make you think that some ads of their’s can be misunderstood as the other’s. I love this game and I hope they could fix these issues to make it better and more enjoyable.",

All the other ratings are being too nice to the developers just because the topic is about destroying something you hate but this rating here is honestly the best one. If the developers are reading this then here is what I recommend, add npcs, add a actual child as the main character since it would make sense, a gender option, a small cutscene to show why the main character is upset and make the school you are smashing look more modern/realistic.",

They must came from the employees or friends of the company.  \n\nDon't use these apps by this company \"iBigToy\" to learn English, unless you want to learn \"Chinese English\". BAD pronunciation and super slow flat boring reading.  \nThe drawing and Chinese reading are good. I give one star for that.  But I wouldn't recommend this for kids.  I have to delete all apps by iBigToy from my iPad. Hay, I have a 3 years old who plays my iPad every day. Luckily  I got all these apps when they were free.\n\n千万别用这个公司 'iBigToy' 的软件学英语。这读英语的姐姐发音不是很标准，并且读的比蜗牛还要慢而且平旦无味。好象才学的英文，一个字一个字的念，实在听不下去。这样念给小孩听是不对的。真是误入子弟。\n\n中文版还可以，卡通也画的不错。这公司因该花了不心血做了这么多apps. 应该请个专业读书的老外重新来过。我就可以重新加分。但是现在我必许把这些软件删除。我不想影响到我的小女儿。",

The quiz layout is simple and easy to drill yourself with. There is one issue that keeps me from giving it five stars, however. It's that your mastery of words is not recorded separately for the three quiz types. For example, say I take the default quiz (japanese word with english multiple choice options) a few times and master a word in that quiz. That word is now also mastered in the kanji quizzes and the reversed vocab quiz (the one that gives an english word with japanese multiple choice options). Even if i have never studied that word reversed or studied its kanji, it will not appear in the other quiz types. I think it would be much more helpful if all three quiz sections were completely separate from each other, and i was forced to master every word in every category. Despite this, the app is still worth trying out and purchasing if you like it.",
