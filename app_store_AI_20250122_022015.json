Wrong. All I wanted to do was upload a photo from my camera roll and I can see it in my gallery, but when I go to Canva, it doesn’t even appear as a choice. Fine let’s try a different photo… select camera roll and upload that photo, says that it is uploading and nothing happens and it goes back to the home page. 🧐 Try something different. That’s just two examples in the 20 minutes I was trying before I gave up. Then it asked me for a review. Now I’m here 🙃 Will be deleting this app.",

I asked it factual questions about a particularly well known athlete. It gave a very detailed and convincing response that was straight up false. I corrected it and it replied “you’re absolutely correct. Sorry about that.” Then it went on to “correct” the mistake by giving another factually false response. Also it often gets very basic math questions incorrect. But it has helped me map out some very useful plans for my business, plans for my fitness (personalized Meal and workout programs), as well as some financials plans. All in all, a great tool but for the user sure needs to double check its work.",

There needs to be a tab for adults only simple 21 and up it up just created it if we gotta pay for it, I’d pay for it a grown man on this app shouldn’t have to be restricted or censored my writing is going down just because I stop using it for three months I come back and now mostly anything that I’m trying to generate does follow guidelines stop catering to younger audiences.",

        "內容": "This app is great when it does what you want, but horrible when it doesn’t. There are times it removed the background but left the doll stand showing! Then when creating an ai background, when you finally find the right one (which at times can take hours), if you move your image, the background changes! Usually to a horrible one. There is a “lock” feature in layers, but the background still changes, so the lock feature is useless. You can also save your background to “brand kit” but good luck finding it! You can also create a template from your design, but it saves the entire design as the background. So if you want to put a different image, it will just be on top of all the other images you used for that template instead of being able to remove it and only use the background. Finding a good ai image is the luck of the draw. You can describe what you want but sometimes it’s horrible. Describe the same exact thing using a different image, and it comes out perfect! Try to get the same background for another image and you won’t be able to. I wish there was a way to save the background or actually lock it not to change so that you can use different images with the same background. As for now, that is not an available feature.\nAlso, sometimes when you save an image, there’s no watermark. And other times a watermark covers the entire photo multiple times, so there’s no way to use the image. So in conclusion, sometimes this app is great, sometimes it’s not.",

Anyways, I don’t now what an idle game is but it is supposed to be a boring type of game and this is not boring at all, in fact this entertains me soo much. I just love watching the little cats chop soup and AHHH!! I have had this game for one day, and I have already named and dressed up and fallen in love with my cats and this game. The one thing which is not a problem with me that much and hasn’t happened any more and is just probably something wrong with my tablet. But what happened, was I watched an ad for something and the ad started to glitch, and…I got kicked out. But I quickly got back in and it didn’t do nothing to it. So it is like my favorite game. I have a time limit of only 1 hour on my iPad and I always use three fourths of it on this amazing game. And every time I go on to the game and see my cute little Hammy’s face (one of my cat’s names), It just makes me just like 100x better especially since I’m sick. Anyway this is a great game and I think everybody, I mean EVERYBODY! Should have this game because it is amazing. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈‍⬛🐈🐈‍⬛🐈🐈‍⬛🐈🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱",

Back in June of 2022, I had an ex who cheated on me, I was heart broken, I changed my career during that time as well so I was dealing with stress from that as well. I randomly downloaded this game finding it on tiktok. I love cats so I down loaded right away. I played it for awhile. I loved it so much cause it was so relaxing and kept my mind off of the ex boyfriend😂😂 Then I quit playing once it seemed like it was impossible for me to purchase more cats and cooking stations (I had no clue the app needed an update at the time). Now….in 2025 I downloaded again. I have a newborn baby (my first ever baby) and I cannot return to work because my husband and my work schedules do not work out for it, we have no family near us and no good baby sitters. It’s been tough for me being stuck at home. I randomly started playing this game again, and since I updated it…the game has gotten so much cuter I wanna cry. It’s crazy how relaxing this game is. I love it so much. I love the cats, all the cute sounds that are made when the cats are preparing ingredients♥️♥️",

Focusing on the cute cats and getting enough money for more easily distracts me. What's even better: this game has like no ads. So I'm able to focus on the cute kitties and decorating. It's also a super idle friendly game and lets you have something to just tap every once in a while whilst doing homework, watching a show, sitting around, PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. I just adore it.",

        "內容": "The game is great. I love dressing up my little cats, hearing their little sound effects, and decorating. It’s idle so I don’t have to be online to get rewards of earn money. The only reason why I uninstalled is because of the glitching. I’ll do my quests, and earn my rewards but it doesn’t even put them into my account. I’ll watch as the gems I collect go into the bar but don’t move my number of gems. It happens constantly also with the stamps. I’ve got the effect on screen of getting stamps but my number of stamps doesn’t move. That’s the only thing I hate about the game which makes me uninstall because what’s the point of doing little quests and redeeming my stuff if I won’t even have it added to my gems or stamps? It gets annoying and discouraging.",

I started about 4-5 months ago which I thought wasn’t bad. You can customize everything from the stations your cats work at, to the cats rooms, to the actual cats themselves. The cats have hats, clothes, accessories, and even friends. My only gripe comes in at the ads for this game, it’s 100% ad based and they used to have an upgrade available for the sloth manager but they took it away about a year and a half ago. I never got a chance to upgrade mine however my wife did and I regret my decision to not act. All that to say I won’t act like I don’t play the game every day and don’t enjoy playing it, me and my wife both play and we both enjoy it.",

        "內容": "Stopped playing this game for a while and then came back to it. It used to work great, but after updating the game now it won’t stop crashing. Every time I go to take a picture or buy something in cat tower it crashes. Also just by doing random things. Crashes every 3 minutes or so. It’s a shame this last update broke the game for me Update: Recently opened game to see if there is any improvement with the crashes. As usual it crashed, but this time when I reopened I found it reset my progress back. I lost a few letters worth of gold and other items I had collected! It’s another level of frustration when on top of the glitches slowdowns and crashes, now we’re losing our progress! \n\nThis is an issue that many many other users are experiencing, as can be seen by other reviews here and many on the Reddit Cats and Soup thread. It’s concerning that no acknowledgement has been made of this, and makes me feel that this will ultimately not be addressed. I truly hope I’m wrong because this is an enjoyable game.\nEdit: I received an email asking that I contact support for a resolution. The game app sends you to a link that is not working for me",

That is it I am REALLY glad that I downloaded this game because it is a MUST download if you are a cat lover 🐈🐈‍⬛😍",

        "內容": "This game is great, this the only idle game I've ever found myself coming back to over and over again. The cost of add-ons is legitimately absurd (who would pay $45 for enhancements to a single part of gameplay?), but I don't care about that at all because you don't need those enhancements to play or succeed. One very specific suggestion I have is that the basketball game scoring should be scalable. It's such a fun addition, but my high score is currently 400 and the prizes stop after 70. It would be nice if it kept going or maybe even just every additional 50 points after 70 you get more gems or materials. Please implement this, the basketball game is a lot less fun going just for a meaningless high score.",

Once that’s done p, you just simply click the item and it gives you money!\nI also love how it’s not overwhelming, and the fact that there’s music in the background is even better.\nIf you haven’t tried this app, download it!

It’s hard to keep track of what ones I’m missing and I usually end up checking Reddit or the Wiki to see who I’m missing. I have 64 cats and it would be so cool to see my progress as only 3 of those 64 are repeat breeds, or at least I think so seeing as there’s not a great way to track what breeds you’ve collected or how many of each you have. It would also be a cool place to see how you can purchase a different breed, whether it’s through the stamp rally, events, or gifts. If they could update the collection I would give this game 5 stars!",

Worse, the company support is TERRIBLE. Their advice was either basic stuff like reinstalling it or “get a newer device”. This problem has persisted with every update since, so it’s clear that they aren’t gonna fix whatever is broken. This goes beyond a language barrier and into straight up not caring. I had adored this game, but since it’s never gonna be fixed & the publishers don’t care, I would suggest avoiding it. That way you’ll avoid the same disappointment I’ve had.",

I got “two twin girls!” With a picture of 2 grown mustached women one of whom had eyes looking in 2 different directions like a Frankenstein creation.

I understand that gen AI features are expensive, but my problem is with how the pricing is presented.

Sometime back I was offered a lifetime access fee to be able to access this app. All the time without a yearly charge I paid one lump sum. And recently, I noticed that I could not access the app. It says that I was not able to access this in my region. I’m in the US not a Third World country. I contacted Support and they said that they had shut down the app to deal with some other issues which I don’t fully understand. They suggested that I go to Apple and get a refund which I tried to do, but since I purchased the life long access more than six months ago I was not given anything and of course, this app did not offer me that at all they said they don’t offer refunds. So I don’t know what else to do. It’s still shows and it has not been deleted but yet I’m left hanging with the purchase of an app that doesn’t work anymore. I’m not happy.",

Not at all what I paid for and a disappointment. Will not purchase again. I asked five other people, blindly, what they thought and 100% percent said without prompting that it was a completely different person. I wish I could request a refund since it is so obviously not based on my images.",

Lesson plan is pretty scattered, need to supplement with other resources imo. I have to frequently switch to a simple translate app for quick reference. Hard to know where you are or to review lessons(still figuring that out). I have to constantly save “lines” to have the ability to review. No way to organize the saved lines. Saving “phrases” in the AI ends up in a completely different place. I only bought this because of the AI feature, which as a beginner I really don’t use much yet. Super expensive. Overall it’s good, and I enjoy the lessons. The AI seems amazing. You can have spontaneous conversations and it will suggest corrections. You can create any kind of custom lesson. In the long run I think it will work for me. Just removing one star for price and disorganization.",

Now I know it will hang, and I wait, but it frustrating.\n\nThere is no option to disable Copilot, it continually asks if I want the document summarized.  I do not, especially since it costs me a credit if I tap it by mistake.\n\nYou didn’t know that?  Well, now you do!  You get 30 ‘free’ credits each month, then you need to purchase additional credits - IF you use Copilot.\n\nYep!  You PAY monthly to use Office 365, and you PAY to use Copilot!\n\nAdditionally, the logo changed, which is annoying, since I am used to old logo. \n\nI am very close to looking for another document editor!

        "內容": "Word on iPad has potential to be great but is plagued by two major issues:  1) dictation is erratic, sometimes working great, sometimes missing spaces, jamming words togethe; and 2) more recently, the lag when typing from a Bluetooth keyboard makes it almost unusable—often I type several words before they appear on the screen (and it’s not a Bluetooth issue—typing this review is working great). Has Word just become too top-heavy with predictive text, auto-correct, and now Copilot to function as a word processor?",

This is disturbing, it just seems we that like the fit, form, function of Outlook constantly get slammed. \nMy opinion. \nPS - a few months ago my laptop stopped and needed a reinstall. I had faithfully backed up with Norton, however, it seems that I still lost all of my local Outlook data, with local and cloud and who knows what all else is programmed into Outlook, how can I trust MS.

        "內容": "Hello. I really like the app and it’s pretty easy to use. I just wanted to share some improvement and ideas. \n\n1. Reimbursement and refund. It would be a great feature to add a refund or reimbursement option to apply on a different account. For example if I pay with my credit card for a bill but I get refunded or reimbursed with cash. There should be an option to apply the refund into my bank account instead of original payment. \n\n2. When making future payments to credit accounts the bank and credit balance is adjusted automatically even before the payment date. This shows inaccurate current balances for both credit and bank. \n\n3. Future balance. It would be great to be able to time travel and check past or future balances of accounts. For example if I want to check what my card and bank balances will be in 3 weeks or what it was a month ago. This can help plan with budgeting for future purchases.",

        "內容": "I can’t save my role play sessions, nor can the AI analyze the whole conversation like it does with my “lesson plan” convos. I paid for the premium version so that I could get access to that type of analysis. Keep in mind I can use ChatGPT to do the same thing, so if I’m paying for a GPT wrapper I want the additional convenience to be worth it. Overall the UI is very nice and I like the main lesson plans. I just want the same summary analysis to be available on the private convos and I want to be able to save these private conversations. Look forward to seeing how this app improves.\n\nEdit: Today I had a convo based on the challenge and was extremely confused because the answers were super complicated and didn’t seem to make sense based on the setup. For example, the AI was asking me if I had advice, yet I was supposed to be a student asking the teacher questions. The AI kept answering in third person saying “the teacher” instead of “I…” Then, I was given two stars instead of three because I didn’t give details on the grading criteria of a hypothetical assignment…when I was the one asking the teacher about the assignment. So because the teacher didn’t explain the grading criteria when I asked, I’m the one who gets a lower score? \n\nLooks like the prompt needs tuning.",

I believe eventually this app will have enough kinks fixed to be quite useful.  I’ve seen other developers try to launch AI language robots and fail so let’s hope this one succeeds.  Communicating vocally and fluidly really helps stimulate authentic communicative learning. \n\nOriginal:\nI thought the idea of it was so good that I paid for a subscription too quickly. Then right when I started using it, the glitches started coming out of all orifices. I’m set at native English speaker learning Japanese, but the translate button on the AI’s sentences translates from Japanese into Japanese, yeah it translates nothing. lol Then I tap on a specific word in the Japanese text and it gives me the definition in Chinese hahahaha No pronunciation in English or romaji, just Chinese. Where did the Chinese come from all of the sudden? Then the feedback for my own sentence doesn’t make sense. It shows incorrect and revised sentences, but they don’t match up with the rationale. The revised example makes a change that isn’t a correction at all, and the rationale explains a mistake that wasn’t demonstrated in the revision. I’ve barely started using it and already the glitches and inconsistencies are every two seconds. Allowing companies to charge money for things that absolutely don’t work at all should be a crime lol. On second thought, it probably already is …. hmmmmmm",

It is updated and expanded very frequently, and very affordable for the full “pro” version (also definitely worth it IMO).  When paired with other editing apps for other more specific things such as face swaps, or certain AI cut/replace tools, it really makes for the perfect finishing touch tool.  Can’t wait for more updates!\n\nSome suggestions; \n\non the AI enhance tool, add some sliders to adjust exactly how it is enhancing (background vs faces.. smoothing vs adding details.. whole photo vs specific areas.. etc..) the app Remini used to be my go-to for AI enhancing(upscaling), and has a some good examples of this, but they have kinda ruined the app over the last few years unfortunately.\n\non AI enhance/outpainting(“expand”) tools.. offer multiple iterations with each result (app called Fotor is a good example, but it has its own limitations)\n\nAdd an AI cut and replace tool (similar to Fotor app), where you can highlight an object/area, and give a text prompt for what to put in its place. \n\nThe “reshape” tool is awesome, and underrated IMO.. would love to see more features added in this for more controlled deformation.  If it could somehow distort the image while updating lighting(highlights/shadows) at the same time that would be incredible, tho I know this would be really hard to do accurately in reality haha.",

        "內容": "It keeps asking me to rate, so here I am.\n\nShort version:\nExtremely lacking compared to Photoshop; Many, downright essential tools are completely missing, the project and layer management is very obtuse and asinine, and overall the app heavily caters to mobile amateur photographers (think Instagram selfie taker) while neglecting non-standard, non-photography use cases. Overall, I think it is misleading to even have Photoshop in the name, as that implies it shares a connection to Photoshop in any way, which is not the case. \n\nLong Version:\nObviously compared to desktop Photoshop this app pales. Though, to start on the positive side, they have actually managed to fit a lot of features into this mobile app, especially if you are focused on quick and easy photograph editing. I think this app is meant for the Instagram selfie takers, so i'm already not in their target market. However, it is missing a LOT of very basic features when compared to desktop photoshop. I already hear your thoughts: \"Of course it is lacking features compared to desktop photoshop, this is on a mobile phone!\" and I understand this point, however, I would consider the features that it lacks to be extremely basic features that pretty much make this worthless for nearly anything that isn't editing Instagram selfies. I will list a few below.\n\nFirstly, HERE ARE NO SELECTIONS AT ALL. No marquee tool, no lasso, nothing. Hidden under \"Combine\" > \"Cutout\" is a masking tool. Yes, MASKING tool. You can \"Cutout\" what the AI detects as objects or \"Add\" and \"Remove\". It never explicitly states what you are adding and removing, but I'll tell you, it's a layer mask. It's styled as a selection with the marching ants, but nope, layer mask. That means you can't simply select an area of your image and apply edits to the selection only, you have to duplicate your image and then apply a mask to the part you want \"selected\". Speaking of application, there is no marquee tool, rectangle tool, lasso tool, or free draw tool under the cutout section, there is only \"Smartcut\" (magic wand tool) and brush. Smartcut selection actually did pretty well in my use cases, but I don't see a reason why a marquee selection isn't an option. Smartcut already draws a rectangular selection before object detection, but whatever. The brush tool will have to do, assuming weird masking lines isn't an issue for you. I also thought that there was no way to transform your \"selection\"/layers, of course there's no transforming a selection, but to transform a layer you need to go out of the tool that looks like a selection and into another tool, it won't let you drag or pinch while in \"Cutout\". However, calling it transform is... optimistic at best, it's more like a 'move and scale' tool. You can only change the scale and position of the layer, oh, and flip it, but that's it. You are locked to the aspect ratio of the original layer, trying to change it only changes the canvas aspect ratio. Now, your natural instinct may be to crop, export, then import the cropped image into your original project, not an option here. Why not? USING CUTOUT DISABLES MOST EDIT OPTIONS. Including most image manipulation and retouching options. As well as crop. Why? Because using the cutout tool converts your project into a \"mix\" project rather than an \"edit\" project. Oh, and doing this IS DESTRUCTIVE! It doesn't save a copy before converting to a mix project, and all of your previous edits are baked in with no way of undoing the edits or conversion. In addition, most edits in this \"mix\" mode are destructive if you leave the editor, with the exception of cutout edits. \n\nYes, completely bizarre decisions here by Adobe. I have no idea about the backend of this app so I can't necessarily say that it would be easy or hard to add the \"cutout\" masking in edit mode, but all project types have full layer control and the Lightroom app does this fairly well, so I can't see why not. \n\nIf your goal is to edit a selfie, instagram beach picture, or something similar, then this app is definitely tailored for you! However, if you are expecting, or even hoping that this app is even 1% as capable as Photoshop desktop, then you will be severely disappointed. They should not have even kept the Photoshop name as it is completely misleading, this is a completely separate image retoucher and has nothing to do with \"Photoshop\", save for the option to send to Photoshop, which never worked for me.\n\nEven something as simple as cutting out the middle of a screenshot was overly encumbered in Photoshop Express. I opened the app because I had a screenshot of a text message and wanted to blank and cut a portion of it out, but from the middle. Apple Photos proved difficult to even blank a portion of the image out, yet impossible to cut the middle out. With my only other option being importing the photo to my desktop for a very simple, quick, 2 minute edit, I decided to try this app for the first time. Even finding cutout was hard since all of the retouching features come up first, and I was looking for a selection tool. Anyways, you get into cutout and then you need to manually draw the area you want to cut out. Then, duplicate the image, use the brush to mask top part of the image that you want to move down, click out of the tool and drag the layer down. Oh, and if I forgot to mention it earlier, there's literally NO SNAPPING. None. Anyways, you can't crop at this point because that would give you the finished image and be too easy. Now you need to export the (uncropped) image, just import the exported image back into Express so you can get into edit mode and access the cropping tool. Why isn't there a cropping tool in mix mode? Or better yet, why can't I just rasterize and convert the project from mix to edit mode when you can the other way around? Many of the methods to do things in this app are just very asinine and don’t make sense.",

Express was clearly not made for those features, it was made for edits like text and filters on images. They just don’t quite fit. Express is also much less capable than Fix and Mix. For example, I have not found a way to change the canvas size on Express, but it was quite easy to do that in the other ones. To make it even worse, so many feature are now payed “Premium” features, including basic things like cloning! It’s just pure greed.",

And I had already on desktop PSD made adjustments to make background editing easy by  increasing contrast bw garment and background , removed any midtones so it’s easy  on iPhone app. Despite these factors it selected  around the edges inside the garment  all over , then there were tiny pixels in areas inside the garment which are faded / not visible unless you zoom in extreme up close . I ended up spending over 1 hr to refine selection and several times the app got stuck and didn’t even save the updated background selection. The AI generator provides no relevant backgrounds despite entering  photoshop background fill options . Even the stamp tool is horrible ! After you select source it will sample from that area for one or two click then sample from some random part and the source picker doesn’t even move so you don’t get to know when it starts to change until it messes up ! Basically the selection source stays in the same location and pick up sample from random places .",

        "內容": "I paid for a year subscription a few months back because I really liked their photo enhancer. You get three “results” to choose from and get to pick the one that looks the best. A recent update (within the last week or two) broke the enhancement results. “Result 1” usually tried to keep the image as close to the original, but typically always looked horrible for old photos (and still does), so I really relied in the past on “Result 2” or “Result 3.”  In the past, “Result 2” was the most complementary to enhancing faces with nice straight teeth, smooth but realistic skin, symmetrical eyes, etc., and “Result 3” was still good, but more likely to make people look older.  NOW, “Result 2” is pretty much complete GARBAGE (basically just changes the shading of “Result 1” and gives people gunk in between their teeth…I’m not kidding - it makes people smiling look like they haven’t brushed their teeth in years) and “Result 3” is really the only truly AI enhanced image.  Ugh, I regret buying this app. If you fix it back to the way it used to work a couple weeks ago, I’ll update this review.  BOTTOM LINE:  PLEASE FIX “RESULT 2” IN THE PHOTO ENHANCER TO BE LIKE IT USED TO BE FOR ALL THE MONTHS I USED IT PRIOR TO WHATEVER YOU DID TO BREAK IT RECENTLY.  I’M SO TIRED OF PAYING GOOD MONEY AND ENDING UP WITH SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT TO BEGIN WITH.",

        "內容": "I’ve been a loyal user of Meitu for years now, but I’m extremely disappointed with the recent experience I’ve had. I’ve always been logged into my Meitu account, but in January 2025, I was logged out without my knowledge. When I opened the app again, I was hit with a prompt saying I needed to subscribe to use features I already had access to. Without realizing it, I accidentally ended up subscribing again, resulting in me having two active subscriptions.\n\nThe second subscription, which I did not intend to sign up for, is now marked as “Not eligible for refund” despite the fact that it was an accidental charge due to the system logging me out. Apple support chat was also unable to help me. I’ve always been a paying customer, and this situation feels like a technical glitch that is being unfairly penalized. It’s incredibly frustrating to be out the equivalent of seven months of subscription fees for something I wasn’t aware I had to be vigilant of. \n\nPlease improve your login system and refund policy to prevent this from happening to other users. It’s hard to feel loyal to an app that causes this kind of unnecessary hassle.",

        "內容": "So i’ve been using this app for almost 2 years and it works really well. The only feature I use is the quality feature, which bumps up the quality for my videos. But the problem is that I used to be able to use it 6x (or more) times a day. Now it’s been reduced to 1x a day, if you have pro/premium. This is very upsetting for me because I am an editor and I desire to make multiple edits a day, but with this one singular use of HD quality I have, I can’t post edits very often or else it will look bad. Another problem is that I simply can’t open the app, it automatically kicks me out. Now I have to result to redownloading the app every time I use it so i’m able to enter the app. I’ve tried shutting down my device and turning the wifi back on but it still kicks me out.",

You are absolutely awesome for that - best customer support experience - (plz do it on web version as well I will be eternally grateful ) \n\nAnother idea -> if I could have a mind map like obsidian notes except better and it works as a notion mind map for all my subpages - If I could open one note project page and have a mind map displaying all the correlated concepts that could be tagged / color coded \n\nI could organize and see the hundreds of stacks in some kind of infinite canvas mind map which helps see everything in a way which helps connect the dots via all the tags with different colors on different notes - even a search feature embedded on the mind map that focuses on the correlated thought chains / tagged blocks \n\n - If you implemented this I would be eternally grateful 🙏\n\nThank you - I love your whole team 🚀",

However, notion AI (more than one message) is not included and must be added separately, which I’m actually ok with, but it’s unable to be added on iOS. When I tried to add this on the website, it says I can’t add it because I subscribed via the app. \n\nWhen you google this issue, you will find that people have complained about this with no resolution for over 18 months. \n\nThe current workaround is canceling the iOS subscription, waiting for the month or year to expire (or some sketchy refund tactics), and then subscribing online. I don’t understand what decision makers decided that is acceptable. I can only assume incompetence since it’s literally counterproductive to the profitability, but that incompetence makes me apprehensive to use the platform, as my data in Notion is proprietary, so if the poor execution is systemic, it could be potentially harmful.",

Try it out, you won’t be disappointed. The free options are great, the paid options are less desirable with the latest price increase. I have lowered my review to 4 stars. As much as I love this app, I think $39 a year is way too much to ask.",

Lo, although it showed the hover “insert” cursor over the text input fields, I couldn’t actually click in the letters to edit them.\n\nOdd, I think. Maybe I need to restart my phone or maybe there’s an incompatibility with the latest iOS revision, or …?",

        "內容": "I’ve used this over the years to get random people into my contacts fairly quickly. It’s 80-90% accurate and saves a few minutes of manual labor. However, today I apparently reached 100 total business cards of scanning over the past 6 years or so, and now it will cost me $47.00 per year to continue using it. Sorry, good program, but for that rate I’ll spend a few minutes a month manually entering data. Too bad no “consumer” version of this with a purchase (not subscription) price of ten bucks or so, they could limit it to 15 cards a month and I’d be fine with this. Apparently they are also data mining, which is concerning but so typical. \n\nIt is about 10 percent inaccurate, which is pretty good in my estimation considering all the different typefaces, lighting concerns, etc. One bummer is it requires you to use their camera app and it’s automatic- meaning they trigger the photo, not you. I’d rather import, including batch from my photo album, so I can be sure it’s not a blurry photo. At least give me control over the trigger!\n\nSo it seems 100 total cards per lifetime is the maximum limit of before  the $47.00 per year subscription is required. I’m just an average fool on a limited income without an expense account, so I’ll be deleting this and back to manually entering doctor details straight into my contacts. It’s a shame there’s no “stripped down” version for regular people using their technology but I understand the restraints of capitalism and needing “scarcity” to survive.",

But for my fellow science majors we need to be able to point out structures on photos and it’s difficult when photos are only added to definitions. Even after reversing my entire set I wish I could be able to add photos to term OR definition depending on each card. This isn’t a difficult feature to add and I will be less likely to search for other study apps if it was more convenient to make my own study sets.",

Like are you actually kidding. If I was actually semantically learning my vocab then it could be argued that premium is fair but for what it offers the audacity to make me pay pisses me off. I’m currently trying to learn some vocab and I gave up on Quizlet. I’m about to pull out a pen and paper and memorize this stupid vocab like they did in the prehistoric times.

I use this myself for my tests/quizzes and it helps me so much, that is one reason I am a straight A student. \n\tThe thing is that is sometimes corrects you for spelling something slightly wrong, like adding an s at the end of the word. It’s not that bad though because it helps me to spell something so I can learn and that’s great for spelling tests. Also, you can only do that test once, unless you get Quizlet Plus, which is a little thing you have to pay for. It lets you do that same test as many times as you want. If you don’t have Quizlet Plus, you can either find a new test from someone else or if you think you’ve had enough, you can stop.\n\tI highly recommend this app for students, teachers, and parents of students so you, your student, or child can have excellent grades. It helps with your studies and you can make your own Quizlet as well. It is 100% safe for kids and it has no adds.",

It unfortunately does not work in the background, so what I have been doing is setting my phone to Auto-Lock > Never and then turning off touch using Guided Access so that it can be uninterrupted. However, I can’t use my phone while I’m letting it back up.\n\nOverall pretty good app and hoping to save some storage with it (although just having the app is filling up my storage EVEN MORE [currently 700 MB which is my largest app]) but it is nuanced and requires some “working with what is given”.",

So I have had to quit using the app and I am going to have to manually go through thousands upon thousands of videos after downloading to my computer!! I had spent hours a week going through on my iPhone to only have them all put back on to my phone! \nI strongly suggest NOT using this app as Backup!

I’d be happy to watch an ad or two before I edit a photo. \n\nBut instead…. anytime you test a new font, or do anything at all to the photo you have to watch an ad! It’s so excessive. To just TRY a font it’s a 15-30 second ad. Absolutely disgusting. They don’t even have this many ads on F2P games. Click any button at all and an ad pops up. \n\nAny reviewer who complains about this gets the same copy/paste response that ads are necessary to run the service. In reality, they’ve done this intentionally so you get so frustrated by the interruptions you just pay to remove ads (vs watching 1-2 ads prior to editing). Not going to give a company like that money.",

For the documents that do open, the app will regularly quit at the same places in each document while scrolling through the pages or while scrolling through the comments. I stopped before attempting any edits. I might be able to use word iOS for short personal documents. But not for the ones I get paid to work on.\n\nUpdate - crashes even more with the copilot menu item in the toolbar. Please add an option to disable copilot.",

Customers try to get away from them, but it requires a constant elevation toward new and different, and also not as good. Microsoft itself, is not so good as it once was, but it grinds on, mostly on those of us who just want to type a page and hit print, or save. They have an answer for that, save here, no there, or in this format, oh no, not that one, this new format. There is always an evolution, toward something that isn’t about good, it is about away. Away from where they were. They aren’t alone, google is there with them, then there is apple. Too much to say. Just this then, Microsoft Word is a predatory platform of mediocrity. It was never GREAT, but it was pretty good. Now after we’ve paid for it, and paid for it, and continue to pay for it….",

Additionally, your projects on PowerDirector for PC do not sync with the mobile app. You have to sign up again for this. Essentially the mobile app is a standalone app and no relation at all to anything on your PC. Even free Canva syncs from PC to phone to iPad.

We could use a color wheel option to color the highlights, midtones and shadows individually for a more cinematic look. \n\nThe new Ai audio tools are cool, but it would be even better with if you could dial in the voice changer with sliders. The stock audio is decent; would be great if audio loops were included that you could drop in and set the length to play for as long as you want instead of having to duplicate the track over and over again. \n\nEither way it’s still my go to app and worth the annual payment.",

        "內容": "A few issues.  First is that I signed up for the free 7 day trial and was immediately charged for a membership.  Dishonest.  Second, I downloaded this app to make a 90 second cartoon video.  It says you need a premium acct to do that, and I now had that (see above). But, once you sign up, when you try to create a video it tells you that IN ADDITION to the premium membership, you have to buy credits to make videos, depending on how long your video is. To make a 30 sec video, you need 120 credits and that costs $18, which is listed as a temporary special for $9.  Still, that’s $9 as long as the sale lasts for 30 seconds in addition to the premium monthly fee. I would not have downloaded this app if making a 90 second video would cost me $34.  If they’d been upfront about costs, I could have save a lot of time also.  At the end of the day, I’m out the monthly fee of $7, and I’m disappointed but wiser.  So I thought I’d let others know.",

For example, you can pay $2 for 254 messages or jam’s but depending on the type of chat, it takes 2-3 of those, it is x jam is per message, I believe. You can get one free chat a day with a spin. The app is pink, which is very cute, and the chat is good, but other than that, I would recommend another app.",

Unfortunately google is releasing more user friendly tools vs the others but I feel like it’s coming at the cost of quality and what we are really wanting in AI. I hope others can catch the consumer appeal soon before google has too much of the market share.",

As other Reviewers mention, there are so many bugs, drop-downs that disappear, reduced functionality, it only can be used in landscape mode, useless pop-ups that take up the entire work screen, and repeated crashing while working. There was a period where I could not access any fonts, because the drop-down only showed a sliver of the name of each font, Meaning, I could barely see what I was scrolling to find. At another point, I used the blending tool and wanted to revert to another effect in the drop-down screen which showed a ghost of a screen, then disappeared and I was unable to fix the layer. What’s most upsetting is that I worked on a post that I wanted to turn into a flyer and the resize feature would not stop sending error codes. I contacted support- their name was Mushafiq, and they told me to use Chrome. Chrome just has a landing page that takes you back to the app. I sent them a screenshot and they ended the chat with no further comment or resolution. I’m tired of wasting my time and energy on this Adobe product and will be finding an alternative ASAP.",

However, the new version is very difficult to use and create my standard content, forcing me to cancel my subscription and find something more user friendly. This has also forced me to change the appearance of my content.  I am very disappointed and frustrated with the changes. At least give the option to use the OLD FORMAT.",

Not intuitive, freezes up, and user interface is just awful!  Thankfully, it allows me to revert to the previous version when I launch the app, but even the old version is struggling since this latest update came out.  I assume this option to go back to the previous version will eventually go away when Adobe decides they want to force this disaster of a version upon us.  Why screw with something that was working and was simple to use and understand.  At this point, I am looking for an alternate that is no frills and easy to use.",

It’s the only feature I need that’s missing from the iOS apps. Because of this, and only because of this, I have to travel with my dell laptop and my iPad. I’m sure it’s Apple’s fault, but I should be able to do it through the iPad ppt app, or at least chrome or edge. But the iPad is too smart for that. Back to the dell. Grow up, PowerPoint!",

I’m talking 4 hours for a picture of a dog, a poem & some paw prints. Horrible. The collages would not print without margins & all the pictures came out super light. To top it off, I thought my free trial ending 12/8 meant I could cancel on 12/9 but was wrong & was charged $39.99 which is a complete rip off. Especially since most of the options are “vip.” You charged me $39.99 for an app that can’t even spell yearly right & have the nerve to have a plan that costs more than that?? Of course Apple will not refund because that’s what Apple does so I’ll file a complaint with the FTC for this & all the charges they refuse to refund for my minor children over the years & hope that there will be another lawsuit against them some day. There is nothing about this app that is worth $39.99 & if you want to try it, be mindful of the date the free trial ends because you will be charged.",

    "應用描述": "StressWatch 已被全球 171 個國家/地區蘋果應用商店推薦——\n◎ 八月最佳 APP\n◎ The Best Apps for iOS 18\n◎ 首頁主打推薦\n◎ Apple Watch 必備\n◎ 新 APP 推薦\n◎ 本周編輯推薦\n\nStressWatch透過分析蘋果手錶HRV心率變異性和靜息心率等數據，幫助你理解當前身體疲勞和心理壓力程度，及時提醒壓力狀態，幫助你更好地感知、管理與應對壓力。StressWatch透過讀取蘋果手錶存儲到蘋果健康內的心率數據來檢測你的HRV（Heart Rate Variability，心率變異性）和靜息心率，及時提醒你的壓力狀態，通過統計分析給出相關洞察，讓身心更平靜輕鬆。生活慢一點也可以溫柔閃亮！\n\nStressWatch可以怎樣幫到你\n\n當我們在深夜加班的時候，StressWatch可以在手錶上提醒我HRV偏低注意壓力——我意識到我今天不需要再卷了，工作留到明天做吧；\n當社恐的我們混在派對裡強顏歡笑的時候，提醒我HRV偏低注意壓力——我意識到我不需要迎合他人，於是換個讓自己更開心的社交方式；\n當我們在喝悶酒時候，提醒我HRV過低壓力過載，我意識到喝酒並不是排解壓力的好辦法，於是會少喝一些更愛惜自己身體；\n把HRV讀數放在手錶表盤上，一抬腕就知道最近的壓力狀況，決定接下來是要卷還是躺；\n堅持良好作息、運動一段時間後，通過每周、每月的統計告訴我這段時間的壓力值比上個月明顯有所下降，整個人狀態都好了很多。\n為什麼做這個產品\n這是一個內卷又焦慮的時代，AI每天都在爆炸性的發展，彷彿要取代我們所有人的工作。每家公司都在996，每個人都活在一不努力就可能被時代抛棄的巨大壓力中。曾經我們也是公司裡的卷王，經常為了公司項目從早上八點一直卷到晚上十二點，跨時區會議多數還拖堂到凌晨。週末彷彿變成了一個遙遠的概念，為了產品能按時上線，放棄週末去加班變成了基本操作。卷得太劇烈，壓力過大，身體都默默承受了，後移的髮際線是身體的求救信號。於是我們開始思考，有沒有更及時的方式能讓我們了解身體的壓力水平。偶然機會了解到HRV這個概念，借助它可以很好地量化我們自身的壓力。\n\n設計理念\n做StressWatch這個App的初衷是想幫助大家在這個焦慮的時代減少壓力慢下來。StressWatch的科學依據是基於HRV（心率變異性）數值的靜息心率的壓力測量，但僅僅告訴用戶冰冷數字容易營造出悲壯的「壓力過載」氛圍（我們不希望大家比慘），生活中也已經有太多的數字了，OKR、KPI、NPS。我們一直在思考，如何給理性的數據注入一些溫度？應該用什麼樣的情感化表達，幫助大家更好的和產品連接以產生共情。\n於是，就有了「壓力泡泡」這個產品形象，「泡泡」就是我們克服壓力緩解焦慮的夥伴，他會隨著你的壓力狀態變化改變自己的顏色，但是無論壓力如何都能泰然處之。我們沒法控制外在的環境，就像我們沒法控制天氣一樣。但無論外面是晴天、雨天、甚至暴風雨，當不同壓力狀態的你每次打開app，都能看到一個神情自如、可愛輕鬆的泡泡。TA提醒你慢一些，在你最慌亂的時候給你的心一個柔軟的擁抱。\n\n未來產品功能規劃\n\n- 更豐富的手錶表盤掛件\n- 手機桌面小組件\n- 快速HRV測量\n- HRV和靜息心率趨勢\n- 每日恢復狀態評估\n- 歡迎聯繫我們\n\n你可以通過以下方式找到我們\n電子郵箱: badideas100@hotmail.com\n小紅書 @StressWatch App\n\n非常期待聽到你的建議，你的支持和建議是我們不斷迭代的動力來源！\n蘋果健康整合\nStressWatch通過蘋果健康讀取來自蘋果手錶的心率健康數據。StressWatch需要獲取蘋果健康的讀取授權，以提醒、統計壓力時刻、提供建議，否則無法正常使用。請放心，你的健康數據僅儲存在本地，我們不上傳任何你的健康數據。\n\n訂閱價格和條款\nStressWatch可以免費下載，若選擇升級到StressWatch Pro版本，則可以解鎖所有付費功能。\n我們提供一次性購買、按月和按年自動續訂三種不同的購買選項。\n\n按月或按年訂閱的說明：確認並支付後，將通過你的蘋果iTunes帳號自動續訂。扣費成功後，順延一個訂閱周期。若需退訂，請在當前訂閱期結束前至少24小時內，手動在iTunes / Apple ID設置管理中關閉自動續費功能。試用期內，如不取消訂閱，則會在試用期結束時自動開通訂閱並扣款。本服務由您自助選擇是否取消，若您選擇不取消，將為您開通下一個計費周期的續費服務。\n\n健康建議的免責聲明\nStressWatch提供的所有信息和建議不可以被視作醫療建議或診斷，請勿替代專業的診斷和治療。如果感覺壓力過大無法調節，以及做出任何醫療決定之前，請及時尋求專業醫生幫助。\n\n用戶協議和隱私條款\n用戶協議 https://100badideas.notion.site/Terms-of-Use-5518359e0a234729ae94bdb94d983183\n隱私條款 https://100badideas.notion.site/Privacy-Policy-79e458f14518433aa0c0322d678daa1a",

        "內容": "I love this app and am a paying member for the time being. This has been helpful in training me to tune into my body and recognize what stress feels like. I’ve even started to notice high stress levels on my own a few times now which is a really big deal for me. \n\nI’m giving 3 stars because the data analysis is just not where it needs to be in my opinion. In the paid version you can see historical data back as far as it goes and you have the option to log how you are feeling mentally and physically at the time of a stress notification. You can also associate that notification with things like work, fitness, and alcohol and you can add your own custom ones as well. While logging these things has been helpful for personal reflection and recognition on my own, there is zero analysis of this data in the app. Here are examples of what would be useful:\n-Your HRV is lower and more controlled on days you have not logged alcohol.\n-Your reported feeling focused or energized more on days you have logged fitness.\n- On average you log feeling tense and overwhelmed between 2-5 pm on weekdays 40% of the time. \n- or 60% of your highest stress levels last month were logged between 2-5pm on weekdays. \n\nI want it to recognize patterns in the data so that I can make changes to my life that prevent stress BEFORE it happens, not just while it is happening. \nFor now, I’m going to keep using the app to continue building my skills in recognizing my own body sensations. But after another month or so I will likely cancel my subscription because $13 a month or $40 per year is too expensive just to be able to log how you are feeling and view historical data that has no helpful analysis or pattern recognition.",

Have a glass of wine? Have a cold? Drink a cup of coffee? You’ll get alerts. I’m aware these things have a physical impact on my body, but if I can’t eat a normal meal at a restaurant without 3 hours of being panicked by “overload” readings, there’s an issue. Plus my Apple Watch essentially allows me access to similar data. For the record, I’m active (runner, yoga, etc) and hydrated and generally careful with what I put in my body … but this had me in a constant panic … discussed issue with my physician, but testing shows I’m fine. Also, pretty overpriced given I can get most of the data free.",

Then when I was going through one of the worst most stressful moments the app notified me right then on my watch that my stress level was “great,” that’s when I realized the app was a gimmick and didn’t actually work! Don’t waste your time believing this can track your stress! In fact it’s way more stressful to get the notification that you “are stressed” then being stressed without it. Do yourself a favor and free yourself of this wasteful product, go outside, take a deep breath and go for a walk!",

I was hoping it would provide insights into my episodes since I hadn’t experienced much anxiety before my hospitalization. Despite the high ratings, my experience was disappointing. I used the free version for some time but kept running into glitches, so I was desperate enough to try the free trial. Unfortunately, it was to no avail. The data was hours behind, alerts didn’t come in real time, and it glitched frequently with my watch. After the trial was over, it glitched even more. I tried to fix and repair it, but nothing worked, and deleted the app from my watch and phone. \n\nI requested a refund after a day of trying, but it was unsuccessful. The most frustrating part was the lack of customer support. Despite reaching out multiple times, I received no assistance or satisfactory explanations for the issues I encountered. This was an expensive mistake, and I hope my review helps others avoid a similar error in judgment.\nI never write reviews, but I felt compelled to warn others before purchasing this product. While it wasn’t the most expensive app, having something that doesn’t work as it should shouldn’t be the customer’s burden. Despite the high star rating, consider this app a fraud, even more so after my experience. As a few other people like me have had the same issue, I hope this review helps others avoid a similar mistake.",

Users need to be able to control and lessen the amount and or frequency of the constant stream of information. Yes, you have segregated more services but they’re really establishing a focused body of viewers you can promote for selling advertising to make more revenue.

Since I already paid for it, I figured I might as well utilize it and started trying to use it. The features are OK. Some are better than others, but the problem I have right now. Is that this app positions itself as an AI app, which it is; however, even though I paid for the pro app now I am prompted to purchase credits to utilize their AI features. This is ridiculous, but also if I recruit other individuals to pay for the app or share it on social media, I can earn these credits as well, so the whole thing is pretty much a sham.  I give it two stars because some of the edit in capability is good, but I’m not really sure it’s better than canva pro.",

Introduction of a subscription based service that locks the free version behind ads which weren’t there before is a slap in the face tbh. I’m unsure if they made any sort of announcement about their roadmap and the paywalls they wanted to implement to the core of the app, but the change feels fairly jarring and drastic and I will no longer recommend it. I would absolutely understand a one-time purchase (much like procreate) to support the developers, but a subscription to a non-essential app (who’s now made their free version considerably worse) I can’t bring myself to support.",

However, the developers changed the app so now you have to pay for \"VIP\" status monthly in order to sort by popularity or even just to see some of the recipes. I wouldn't have minded paying a dollar or two for the app, but I resent the idea of monthly payment as this makes it possible for developers to change the price whenever they want; if you didn't catch their notification, they could essentially start withdrawing much higher amount from your bank every month without you realizing. For such reasons I will not be using iCook anymore.",

Basically just lost all reason to ever depend on zoom again and will forever use discord or FaceTime. Thanks guys for paywalling a super cool program that was free for years and years!

I have this bug where after all the messages have been read, zoom still shows an unread badge icon of 1. To fix I have to manually mark a message as unread, close app, open back up, read it, then it shows no unread. I’ve submitted to feedback in the app and no response. I’ve also been through a few updates since the feedback",

We were forced to migrate to smaller meetings using basic conference call technology. Meetings now start quickly, are smaller and fewer. Productivity is once again rising.",

I didn’t anticipate needing to interact with the customer service a few months back and I’ll be honest and I’m a little ashamed to admit that I assumed I would get a representative that either I couldn’t understand or would not be helpful-or both. I got the exact opposite. I got a friendly, eager to help American representative who’s first language was English and whom promptly fixed the issue at hand.",

So I’m texting a friend and all a sudden I get a notification from this scrutinous app. With no warning it doesn’t even say something like “click to see the score.” It just shows the score. 22-28. My favorite team lost. The reason I got the notification in the first place because I put it as my favorite team. Now Google knows DANG WELL THAT IF I HAVE THAT AS MY FAVORITE TEAM IM GOING TO BE WATCHING THE GAME. And this isn’t the first time it’s happened. This has happened COUNTLESS TIMES. This app will no longer be a resident of MY phone. Google, COUNT YOUR DAYS.",

Another sub species , Python m pimbura, from Sir Lanka -previously the island nation of Ceylon, is almost identicacl to the Python m molurus.  Difference is in length and girth, where pimbura is brighter in color, more defind in colour of pattern on skin, with the head being more reddish in nature.  I believe that this snake-once thought to be a separate species will soon be included in being the same species.",

Secondly, I can’t go in setting to block the ai sources.(which is irritating) Thirdly, ai was a useless update because it’s not completely accurate. It’s also not straight to the point which would make simple and quick research a little difficult. So if you can, please at least give us a choice to turn off ai reviews. I would be greatly happy",

Even if the answers were right I still wouldn’t appreciate AI being a feature on Google now. And to top that I can’t log in on anything. Every time I try to log into Pinterest or any other app I have to verify despite the fact I already did and I’m already logged in on Google. Why do I have to do more verification steps? And again with the ai, it’s so icky like just get rid of that. It serves no use and has more cons than pros. Delete the feature for crying out loud.",

        "內容": "This is the premium AI platform that I have used (others tried Copilot Pro, ChatGPT Plus, Perplexity Pro, and Grok on X thus far, and various models on Poe) that is the most advanced in terms of feature set and utility. There’s a lot that it can (sometimes try to) do. Real-time Internet search capability and ability to ingest private data directly is where this bot platform really excels. As my previous sentence alluded to, however, it also has been the most unreliable in terms of availability.\n\nI frequently get issues where a chat prompt or multi step task fails to complete or times out. Sometimes errors are returned that are API related. Sometimes the app is waiting for a response forever as there doesn’t seem to be a local timeout to make the prompt error out after a long time of waiting for a response. It just spins or shows a loading animation of some sort forever. I’ve seen this behavior across their other apps like for desktop and in a web browser so I don’t believe the issues I am seeing are localized to the iOS app. During the times Monica doesn’t respond or errors out, the other third party AI services I mentioned previously all work fine so I know I don’t have a general Internet connectivity issue. This is across multiple Internet connections as well including cellular. Sometimes connecting to a distant VPN server can fix the issue which I am guessing implicates that there is geographical load balancing going on where an issue for one region doesn’t impact the other because they are in separate geographical regions.\n\nIf the Monica team can fix these sporadic system or connectivity failures to make the platform more stable across various Monica user interfaces, then my review would be all 5 stars.",

        "內容": "I love using the FREE options but the pro ones have taken over it’s like the only thing are $51 a year or some a month or something and it’s really really annoying because I really wanna try the Wallpapers for like the initials and stuff and they’re so cute but I can’t use them because they aren’t.free It’s very very very annoying so I suggest you don’t get this app until it has made some changes. I will update if they make changes by the way epic creators to you if you make some of the cute little wallpapers for initials and stuff like that free it’s going to make people want to buy a pro because they know what it’s gonna be like some people can’t do the seven day trial if you make some things free people will problem want the pro they would wanna buy the other things like it and stuff like that but everything is pro and they can’t use anything no one‘s gonna buy  pro so think about these decisions. Will update in neat future. Stay safe.",

I can see why they would create a pro version because they have to make money somehow but 50 dollars seems insane to me, if you aren’t going to purchase the pro version then it isn’t worth messing with because everything is on it.

Not all people are able to pay for pro, and it’d be appreciated if you at least made some of the live wallpapers free!! Also, doesn’t this count as false advertising? You make an ad on TikTok to make it seem like your app is so cool, making it seem you’re giving the power to the downloaded/viewer to have live wallpapers for free. \n\nBut that’s not the case, so please explain, is this false advertising?",

        "內容": "SCAM!!!!! I downloaded the app and selected the free 7-day trial. It said I would get 30 free credits and did not get them. I was going to use the app for hair AI which said it requires no credits. So I got into the hair AI and guess what?! You need credits. Two lies so far. So I went to cancel it right away because it did not have the feature I wanted at a reasonable price (credits are separate from the member ship and not only are they required for EVERYTHING you do, but they are EXPENSIVE) and you do not get many). Apparently they charge you through a third party in which I do not have an account. It does not show up under Apple subscriptions due to this third party and there is no way to cancel through the app directly. I have since seen past reviews that say the same thing, with some people going into their third year being charged after they have attempted to contact the company multiple times. Looks like it is time for an attorney because it is misleading and against the law to say that it is free and you can cancel anytime, yet they provide no way to do that. I have screen shot every interaction I have had with this app and they will be sued if they touch my bank account. Bottom line, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!",

And don’t even get me started on the constant pop-ups pushing overpriced subscriptions. Why would I pay for an app that turns every photo into a cartoonish disaster?\n\nOn top of that, the app is slow, bloated, and crashes more often than not. You’d think with all the money they rake in, they’d invest in basic functionality. Bottom line: avoid this app unless you enjoy frustration and fake-looking selfies.",

Similarly, buying a subscription is easy, but USING the subscription requires BUYING THE TOOLS TO USE IT — while USING it is the point... \n\nUnfortunately, such “scams” (as another user pointed out)—perhaps especially with Microsoft and Adobe, the latter of which has been honing their system for the past decade—indicate a burgeoning wave of such “subscriptions” and other fees to “use” (piecemeal parts of) apps (and games) that we’ve already bought, without any features, leaving the “subscriber” to buy add-ons in or to use the app/subscription.\n\nHowever, WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT—as with gambling boxes and leasing ready-made DLC (sometimes already on the Ubisoft disc you’d bought, which means you’re leasing second key to the content you’ve already bought but don’t have the right to use)—“MONETIZATION STRUCTURES” like this (PR-speak for “how to use psychological insights to chip ever more money from consumers”) SIMPLY CAN’T MAKE IT. SO, if you’d not like to help make such bait-and-switch tactics the order of the day, *don’t give the people who would use it to do so the money to make it happen.*\n\nMeantime, I’ll be happy to feedback about opening performance and interface if the developer agrees to buy it from before having any idea what I’m charging or how much I have to say about it. Doing so might raise the score, as a function of my score for how much I may have liked those parts, averaged in with my review, so far, about the way it’s sold...",

If you are having problems with your servers, charge a higher yearly rate, but don't ask me to subscribe for a year and then turn around and continue to charge for EVERYTHING I try to do! I mean, why did I pay for a yearly subscription? I have read this is the new norm lately by developers. Don't WASTE YOUR time. Oh, I forgot to add the app freezes constantly!! The developers contacted me about their new, improved credit system. I’m still not buying it. Many new developers offer the same service (better) than dealing with a “credit” system when one has paid a yearly subscription. Again, don’t waste your time.",

When we came back to pick up the bags, the house was locked with our bags in it and the host who was in the US, called me and in a rude, offensive manner claimed that we stole his small tv and a fan from the ceiling. A nonsense. We called AirBnb and asked them what we should do. After waiting a couple of ours in front of the house we entered it from the back, the house keeper left the back door open, likely intentionally. We got our bags, noticed missing bottle of Moet, sunglasses. When we called the host and explained that all the things were in place, he started asking for an extra day payment as we entered his house. He again was using offensive words.\nAfter I explained everything to airbnb and provided pictures, they reviewed the case within 2-3 days. After which they blocked my account 😊\nCrazy story on my wedding day. I do not wish anyone such experience.",

Unfortunately I had two extra guests that wanted to attend as well so I asked the host if she could accommodate, which she could not. That was no problem so I decided to cancel and get a bigger Airbnb to fix the problem. For starters, they only gave me a partial refund so kept almost $300 from me when trying to get a new Airbnb. Then they only have options for a refund, either wait 15 business days to get a refund or keep the money in the account and use it right away so I decided to do that so I could book an Airbnb as soon as possible since my trip was in a week away. When I tried to do so I kept getting an error message saying I’m suspected of throwing a party. Which I am 100% not I just have a large larger group of people. Our intentions were to hot tub and go sledding, Nothing more. No matter how many times I tried I would always get this error message so I decided to call Airbnb. When I did so not only did they tell me my account would be blocked from being able to get an Airbnb for a month, they also told me they wouldn’t be able to transfer my $400 to me and it would be stuck in an app that I can’t use. They also said it’s an automated thing and happens all the time so beware if you’re trying to book something in a rush you could be banned for a month randomly. Their attempt to remedy the problem was that I could use my $400 stuck in the account to get a hotel room. What hotel room would fit 10 people? So they won’t give me my money back and they won’t give me the Airbnb. Absolutely horrible customer service do not recommend.",

We chose our first option; it was approved and paid for with confirmation. \n\nTo our surprise the host canceled, stating that the current guests were going to extend their stay. They accepted and took our payment and all they could say was sorry. According, to Airbnb hosts are allowed to advertise and then select which option is better for them and not the end user. Meaning they can run two booking scams and screw people over. \n\nWhen we attempt to go with our second option. The price had gone up by $50-100 as a whole to market to the Wild Card Game. Supply and demand. \n\nThis is one of my grievances with Airbnb and the host. In our last stay; the host continued to watch us through the ring doorbell. Likewise, after we booked that house; she posted a two-page rule book of; “Don't do this or that. “ She continued to state that this was their house and guests would be charged an astronomical amount of money should we break anything. It was like staying at your grandparent's house in the 80s that had plastic on everything.  \n\nI can go on and on - the host needs to disclose everything before accepting a request to stay. \n\nRespectfully, \n\nStaying at a hotel rather than staying at an Airbnb",

It has been 4 days of high stress and talking in circles with no remedy. DO NOT USE THIS APP!! Airbnb and their host has basically stolen over $3200 from us for a mistaken booking that lasted a few minutes at most- we received no services and the dates we were looking at were still out more than 10 days. \nI will update if Airbnb steps up to  remedy this situation, if not we’ll be looking into legal action.",

Spent 3 hours working on a project, decided to take a quick break, clicked !SAVE VIDEO! And I come back and it’s no where to be found. Extremely upsetting, but I decided to give it another chance. Work on it again for another few hours and go to save it, APP LAGGS OUT INSTEAD OF SAVING VIDEO and once again the video is no where to be found in my files. Extremely frustrating, many features that require payment, and clearly not a very high quality app. Multiple hours on this thing, even got the free trial to give it a shot, don’t waste your time on it as I have nothing to show for it other than wasted time.",

But I do have some suggestions and some things I would like to share! I would like to start by saying I don’t like how you have to pay to save your picture now! That’s unfair to all the clients that have been free-saving their pictures for as long as B612 has been an app! Well that is just a suggestion that you drop the prices out, that will make this app the latest trend! Otherwise this app is really incredible thanks!",

        "內容": "I understand that most companies want to make as much money as possible but it’s a bit frustrating when almost all the filters requiere payment for usage. I’m not the type to blindly pay for a subscription, especially for apps. What’s the point of labeling a button “Try Free” when the options that follow it are pay weekly for $4.99 or yearly for $39.99. Do you people not understand the meaning behind the word “free”? The definition of the word “free” is without cost or payment. A daily filter test that recharges every 24h, where you can use the filter once, maybe even twice just to see if you like the filter and are willing to pay for it. That’s free. Viewing a 1-2 minute ad so that you’re able to see the finished image. That’s free. Suggesting I do a weekly payment or a yearly one after I select the option of “Try Free” is not free. It’s misleading. Either actually make it so the “Try Free” button gives the option to view the content without any sort of monetary payment. Or change the button to say “Pay To View”.",

Por lo cual obviamente esperaba buenos resultados y eso trae incluido dos videos de inteligencia artificial. Pues yo quería ver cómo funcionaba y cuando vi cómo se hacía, lo hice con una foto y salió horrible, así que decidí probar con otro filtro diferente de video y también salió horrible. No me dejó rehacer ninguno de los dos con todo y que yo no instalé los videos , por lo cual me parece muy decepcionante.\n\nSegundo, aunque se puede parecer de vez en cuando, la aplicación nunca elige mi tono de piel correcto. Obviamente, algo frustrante porque quería una aplicación que me hiciera caricatura, pero no que me cambiara por completo. Dos cosas que me decepcionan mucho de esta app ya que esperaba mucho de ella.",

The algorithm is designed to manipulate engagement by promoting divisive content, fueling political interference, and amplifying misinformation. It’s no secret that Meta has played a role in shaping public opinion through algorithmic bias and opaque content moderation policies.\n\nBeyond that, Facebook continuously disregards user privacy, harvesting vast amounts of personal data and selling it to advertisers and third parties without meaningful transparency. The platform’s repeated scandals—ranging from Cambridge Analytica to hidden tracking—prove they don’t value user trust.\n\nIf you care about unbiased information and data privacy, steer clear.

        "內容": "I'm writing this as both a user and an app developer to warn others. This app is likely part of an organized international scam operation. Here's what happened to me:\nI had TanTan installed for about a month. While I received messages from multiple supposed female users, they all seemed suspicious, and I never responded. The real issue emerged when I discovered the app was tracking my location in 'Always' mode without my conscious consent.\nYesterday, while driving on Highway 1 in San Francisco, I received an SMS claiming to be about toll charges. The link looked legitimate, but it was actually a phishing scam from a Philippines number (+63). Within minutes of entering my card details, I had to freeze my card.\nAfter investigating how scammers knew my exact location, I found that TanTan was the only app set to 'Always' share my location. This level of location tracking was likely used to enable targeted scams.\nThe app appears to be of Chinese origin and shows clear signs of being part of a sophisticated fraud operation. It's not just a dating app - it's a security threat that can compromise your location data and financial information.\nDO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. If you have it installed, remove it immediately and check your location sharing settings. Your privacy and financial security are at risk.",

Also, every girl that approached me and they were around 20 was 17 miles away from me. Another red flag is after about 10 minutes. They all wanted to either move to WhatsApp or which is not a female move. None of these women live in the same city that I do. Also, they all have the scammer picture, which is the very professional. Not a real woman picture. I would stay 100% away from this app. It has five stars and so many reviews unless the reviews aren’t real either.

        "內容": "If you don’t want to read my detail explanation, save your money on the dating side of the app, but the social media live-streaming site is OK.  \n\nI’ve sent over 500 messages to people who supposedly liked my profile, but I’ve only received two replies—one of which was just a GIF. Some of these profiles show they haven’t been online in over a year, yet somehow they “liked” me recently, which feels suspicious. \n\nThere’s also a live-streaming feature on the app, which is a nice addition. I’ve made friends with one woman through her stream, and we even shared WeChat, which was surprising. I also connected with two guys during a live stream—they seem cool. But ultimately, this is supposed to be a dating app, not just a place to make friends.\n\nI purchased a three-month subscription for about $15, expecting better results. However, I later realized that sending more “super crushes” or unlocking additional features costs $10 a month extra—meaning I ended up paying $30 for three months. Even then, I discovered there’s a more expensive tier, costing $800 a year, just to message the most popular profiles. That’s an entirely separate cost on top of changing search settings or sending more crushes.\n\nThe pricing structure feels misleading because it’s not clear what each subscription level includes. On top of that, many profiles seem fake or inactive, yet they’re still liking profiles to generate activity. I used this app seven years ago when it was simpler, but it’s definitely shifted toward being more of a social platform than a dating app. I wish I’d done more research before subscribing. It’s not just the high price—it’s the confusing benefits and questionable profiles that make me feel like I’ve been scammed.\n\nWith my 500 count, I was not counting scammers which are abundant on this app. The way to notice if they are a scammer is, if they talk about living in Texas, on a trip to London, ask for personal information and (photos, first and last names, age, and your real location), also they discuss cryptocurrency and own luxury brands or something.",

You also can’t change the tattoo design, rotate it, change opacity, do anything. It’s literally a sticker that you can paste on top of your live selfie. You can’t erase the tattoo around clothes or where your body ends so it looks like somebody literally slapped a sticker on a physical photo. The app is terrible now and pointless plus filled with a popup every few minutes trying to get you pay pay $6 a week for pro version. No thanks! Don’t waste your time on this.

You can try on any tattoo design in real-time using your phone’s camera. It's like magic! Just draw a simple smiley face on your skin, and the app will recognize it and place the tattoo right there. It looks so realistic, and you can move around to see it from different angles. This helped me a lot because I could see exactly how a tattoo would look on my arm, leg, or even my back.",

Call quality good. But it’s a pain to use... compared to messenger, WhatsApp, line, viber, Facetime. All perform better than skype in terms of the app. I wish you’d fix it. I liked using skype as my go to call app. I have multiple subscriptions and accounts. Also, when I get calls it is hard to answer quickly. It takes going to a couple screens. Why not just answer it by one touch. As a result, by the time I get to the call, it goes to voicemail. I then have to call them back and they’re calling me back and we are going to each other’s voicemail. Ugh. If you could solve this, it’d be great. Thanks — I wrote the above 10 years ago, and it’s still not great by comparison.   It used to be better before Microsoft bought it.",

        "內容": "If I could give zero stars I would. What’s going on guys!? I’ve had Skype for years because on occasion I need to call the United States. (I live and work overseas). It is a lifeline for me for business and family, etc… however I don’t really need to use it every month. So I liked the credit option where I would use it as needed and then re-up. I went out on a limb a few years ago, and bought a Skype phone number. Then Microsoft took over and I lost my phone number even though I had just paid good money to renew it; I lost the money and the number; money down the drain. Now without warning, you have changed it to a subscription model? Thanks for the heads up. I just got cut off in the middle of a phone conversation and now I can’t get credit to continue it. It was very important. Thanks for nothing!",

        "內容": "As a PRO subscriber, I use this app on a daily basis. You have made huge improvements with ENHANCE and other AI tools. But seriously, now when we exit a project we can’t go back to the PROJECTS page? We have to go to the new useless HOME page and then click PROJECTS and end up at THE TOP OF THE LIST? I have over 1200 projects, and if I was looking at an older one, I now have to scroll through hundreds to get back to where I just was. First you removed the TARGET TOOL which was one of the most useful features. Using the REMOVE tool on black & white images leaves random black blocks all over the image.  The BLUR tool acts erratic and sometimes won’t blur edges unless you duplicate and merge the layer back onto itself first. And even with an Apple Pencil, the TRANSFORM tool rarely does what you want and often deletes the layer forcing you to UNDO. This amazing app just keeps getting worse and worse and more difficult to use. I don’t think the creators are actually using this app before pushing updates. I’m using and iPad Pro 11-inch 4th generation on 17.6.1. And no I’m not installing 18.2 with useless Apple Intelligence and screwed up photos app until the last possible moment.",

Eventually they made it so I had limited uses, and I thought, okay, maybe they just need a little extra money, or the servers need less people using them to be able to keep up. But no, it only got worse, next thing I know, the generative fill feature is locked behind a paywall, any feature that gets popular gets locked behind a paywall, and the free uses are limited to (I am pretty sure) 1 free use before it tells me to pay. I’m probably gonna delete this app now, and by that I mean I will.",

It also doesn’t help that the app likes to give people error messages every now and then. I hope when the next update (if there ever is one) comes, that these issues are fixed. This used to be a really good app when I first started using it regularly. But now, it keeps having all these issues every time I turn around.",

The images I submit even  have more skin covered than the majority of images in the app. I’ve given feedback and sent images that were used to you, twice on the app. If you fix the sensitivity issues, I’ll definitely change my rating.

        "內容": "Videoleap used to be my go-to all in one application of choice for years and I never expected to drop my ratings, but here we are. The prioritization of AI integration appears to have come at the loss of some very basic features. The one that is most inconvenient is that it’s no longer integrated with giphy for stickers. Well you don’t use stickers for advanced video editing, there is a time in a place for them such as making a tutorial video and wanting a quick circle around a highlighted button. But it’s gone. Today I wanted to create a short animation referencing that this is fine meme where again, fire stickers would have been ideal. Instead, I had to choose an overlay with less than ideal fire video. But it has a black background and the chroma feature to remove it is gone/ replaced by their new button “remove background” but that button apparently is not an option to use for the fire overlay. So essentially my entire video is covered up by the stupid black video with red flames. Most people who use video editing phone apps are newbs and they will rely even more on stickers. But no, its gone.\n\nVideoleap also got rid of their integration with their other software. Previously there was a link to quickly open a photoleap (adjacent editing software). It’s gone. \n\nI’m just not sure why they drop features that are clearly helpful. They did the same thing with their OG editing app, ENLIGHT, which I still keep on my iPhone despite the lack of updates because it has features that were never carried over into subsequent releases after they changed the pay model from one time purchase to subscription-based. \n\nThere are plenty of great features about Videoleap, but if I can’t do everything in one place, particularly the basics, it makes me want to look elsewhere for an alternative app before renewal.",

The company redirects you from the apple app to their website, creates you a random user id unbeknownst to you, and charges your account. I only discovered this after some serious digging. Apple was unable to even track the charge due to lightricks disingenuous process of downloading the app. I have emailed them to get a refund, which on their website “they are happy to help with”, but they are not responding.

What I’m saying is that after using the AI Effects feature about 5 times the app will crash and will no longer allow you to use that effect until you completely remove it from your device then install back on to then be allowed another say 5 AI effects and you just repeat this until your brain wants to bleed. So thank you and no thank you but I’ve grown to fond to let you go yet. FIX THIS GUYS COME ON !!!",

        "內容": "I really liked Videoleap. I used to use it since 4 years ago to edit short videos. Once I started making long-form content, I decided to buy the yearly plan at about 39.99 USD at the time (I forgot the exact price) so I can edit my YouTube videos. It was worth it, but I quickly learned that highly edited videos over 8 minutes are extremely unoptimized and need to be put together in separated segments so the entire editing program isn’t horrendously laggy and difficult to work with. I continued using it until the awful addition of a TikTok / Instagram Reels / YouTube shorts type thing was implemented, which I absolutely never used. My discontent with the editor I loved started to grow. It got worse when the program started to use AI generated voices and images, something I’m highly against due to being an artist. They even pulled an Instagram type thing in their terms of service that anything you post / make can be used to fuel their AI machines. Pretty awful for artists and editors alike, not to mention a huge breach of security. \n\nI just checked today to find that the yearly plan has been changed for the worst. It is now $4.99 USD WEEKLY, not monthly as it was before. Worst of all, the yearly plan went from around about $35.00 - $39.00 USD to $89.99 USD per year. This absolutely drove me off, as this is more expensive than most of the high-end editor softwares on PC! It would be more worth the money to just buy a better software altogether. I’m never using Videoleap again as a YouTube editor, even a TikTok editor and such. It’s better to just get a permanent purchase or free software on PC or on mobile.",

It’s as good as any scam, which means it’s genuinely awful and they are not a business at all for the wellbeing of the people. \nSo if anyone is reading this, don’t waste your time and just press back and pick LITERALLY ANY OTHER app and you will get the same if not BETTER quality of an app. \nNot to mention google has been a translator since the dawn of time. Not a very good one, however, they never had the nerve to try and ask one of their consumers for dime. \nReally disappointing that theirs so many selfish awful businesses in this day and age. I’d even go as far as to say it’s terrifying.",

That is technically good, but it just makes you play for so long with all those red dots that I NEED to click on. But I love this game and the creators seem nice, even with all the paid offers.",

The game moves its like the buttons on my end don’t work because the music still plays and the little candy corn thing still moves next to gingerbrave I just can’t do anything and if it’s not going to get fixed I think I’m just going to quit even trying to play it.",

Yeah, like every Ai generator, there is always going to be misperceptions like hand fingers for example, but other than that, this generator has many filter to choose from. My favorites are Anime, Anime XL, Mixed Style, Vivid, Nostalgic Anime XL, Expressive 2.5D XL, Radiant XL, Block Colors XL, Combat Ink XL, Kyoto, Kyoto Style, 90s, Giant Legend and Machinery of War. These in my honest opinion are what make this Generation the best in the market, at least for IPhone. Also, this Generator allows to enter more spicy words which other generators wouldn't allow. I am very happy with UniDream and I hope they keep doing good work this their Generator.",

When I originally downloaded the app, they didn’t allow NSFW content on the realistic “photography” style. Which is to be expected. I wasn’t too upset about that. For a very short time, they removed the filter recently, which allowed NSFW content in ALL styles! Great! But, very recently they banned NSFW pictures in ALL styles. Now there is NO NSFW content. I mean I don’t understand. How do you allow us to make NSFW content, bait us into purchasing a membership, then pull the plug, and leave us hanging? Pros: I really like this app, the styles are good, the AI drawings are amazing. Cons: The new “coin” system is straight up confusing, and greedy. Now u use “coins” to make AI pictures, and free services (like AI recognition) now use “coins” which is straight up stupid. Like what happened to the old system where u just had limited pictures a month? Removed NSFW content. Which as previously stated, is a total bait and switch. I’m even tempted in asking for a refund. ————————————————————————\nEdit: They added back NSFW content, therefore I will give it 4 stars. However, this should have never happened in the first place. Edit: They removed it again…\n\nEdit: They removed it again! 2 Stars!",

I wanted to try my own picture in my library with different settings and different times and maybe from anime to enhanced photo kind of thing or see myself in different situations or outfits and I have no idea if this can even do that, but I wouldn’t even know where to begin to try? perhaps you really need to be a graphic artist to play with a program like this to do simple things you might want to do for fun but my first was I don’t know maybe half an hour and I didn’t get anywhere I wanted to be or understand if the things I wanted are something that this program can do. I had no understanding of what I had done. I will say that by submitting my picture and then trying to make it into 3-D model I was completely unrecognizable and it looks like I had already used two or three “cards trying to go backwards or tried to do something different to understand.

It’s a good app but respectfully I believe that getting rid of that feature was a mistake, especially considering how good it was.",

        "內容": "This app has been there for me for YEARS. This app works great, and has always had exactly what I needed, when I needed it. There have never been ads. However, I’ve recently used the app and discovered that ads are EVERYWHERE. I can’t do a simple action in the app without watching an ad! It’s hard to get done what I need to get done with this excessive advertising that used to not be in the way. I’m incredibly disappointed because it took me almost ten minutes to put two photos into a side by side basic collage. That’s it. The app is not the same anymore. It used to take me about 2 minutes. That’s why I give three stars. Yes, I know- “first world problems”- but this review is based on the functionality and quality of the app. Honestly, not gonna lie it hurts to leave this review. This app has been my one and only- therefore favorite- for years because of how quickly and smoothly I could get things done (and it has every feature and I didn’t need other tools, all in one place!). And now it’s just like every other app. Might as well find a new one that hasn’t been soiled yet.",

It even tracked my playlists from my account and yet, there is no feature to be found where I can access and play. Maybe they put the feature behind the paywall but I ain’t spending money on an AI app. They either put the feature in there somehow someway without any hassle nor payment OR put back up their music player app because forcing their users into using AI app for the so called good ain’t really good at all.",

I know you can “regenerate answer with GPT4” but who wants to resort to that on Day 1.\n\nThey also promote it as unlike OpenAi, it runs with built-in features like weather and browse. **Again, untrue; to use those tools you have to click and enable the function. Which is pretty much the same as enabling plugins on OpenAi.\n\nImage gen was very bad.\nBrowse worked only once.\n\nSorry, I really wanted to like this because of the relative success of MixerBoxer’s plugins. Just isn’t a good product yet.",

        "內容": "I’ve been using Papago for about four years. In the beginning there were significant issues with translation (I’m using for both Korean and Japanese). The issues were particularly with Korean. Being new to Hangul, I didn’t understand the sentence structure and the app didn’t work well with helping to understand that aspect. With the help of other sources I was finally able to figure out, for the most part, how to put together sentences and phrases. It still translates some words and sentences awkwardly and differently than other translation apps. I’m actually still trying to figure some of those out. In certain cases I just go with what the majority of the other apps say. But I’m writing a review today for one very important (to me at least) that seems to not be working as well as previously. I think it’s very important especially to foreigners and those who are younger who are using this app. There is an “honorific” option when translating. Recently, I’ve noticed it’s not working as it has in the past. I’m not saying it just gives outright casual translation, but it certainly doesn’t provide the ”니다“ ending like it used to. I understand not everything ends with “니다” , but it seems like there’s more of the “요“ ending instead. This is just my personal opinion, but if I’m speaking to someone who I don’t know and who is older than me I would rather use the more formal ending. Please take these suggestions into consideration. 감사합니다.",

        "內容": "Google is better, it differenciates the differet meanings for saying hello in korean. For example when You say hello google says 안녀하새요, when you say hi it says 안녕, showing formal and informal, but when u put in hey, hi, or hello in here, they all say 안녕하새요. It also mixes both informal and formal words and doesnt tell u which is which, it gave me a formal form of bye then gave me a simple form of another. The translations are so wrong and im not even fluent, it adds so many unecessary words to the definition",

        "內容": "The screen reading feature is really helpful for un-translated YouTube video captions. But the interface needs a lot of work and the program is really buggy. Recently, the video feature started defaulting to portrait mode and you have to rotate your device several times to force it back to horizontal. I’d like to see a preference that just locks horizontal mode. The audio (speech) feature really doesn’t work most of the time. As with all translation programs, I wish there was a preference to translate into English without altering the syntax. For example, if the foreign language text literally reads, “Bathroom, where is it at?” I’d like to be able to see the translation that way rather than, “Where is the Bathroom?” It’s much easier to learn a foreign language if you learn to think in the native syntax.",

        "內容": "I’ve been playing this game for over a year now, or trying to play but it’s near impossible with the constant bugs I have. \n\nIt’s not a gameplay bug or anything of that nature, but the game will always close itself out for no reason.\n\nI’ve encountered this issue almost every time I launch the app on my phone. It works fine for a bit but then the random crash always occurs.\n\nIn fact, most of the time, the amount of time I spend playing the game is dependent on when the random crash occurs. When it crashes, even if I launch the game again it seems like it will crash in an even shorter amount of time. Sometimes it will crash on specific triggers which make no sense, like opening a menu, something that doesn’t take any processing power. Never have I crashed while in combat or actual gameplay. Sometimes it gets so bad the game crashes when it boots up.\n\nI don’t know if it’s because I have an iPhone 11? Either way it’s unacceptable, the game should be formatted for most recent iPhone versions.\n\nI only bring this up since this issue has existed the entire time I’ve played the game. I won’t be installing it until I see this specific issue being mention in some patch. If I do get some developer response please do something about this.\n\nP.S. since I’ve gotten used to crashes and starting the game over and over again, I’ve grown to hate the extremely long loading times to boot the game, it takes about a min to actually launch which is kinda crazy in my book. Though this annoyance could be due to my other situation, but faster loading times on everything would also be a big plus.",

        "內容": "This app is truly incredible once you take time to explore what it can do and use creative thinking. I made the mistake for a while of avoiding functions that i didn’t understand by their name alone but once i began learning what each thing is the whole experience really opened up and it’s great. The wait times are not bad at all, seconds basically, compared to many other similar apps that crash and stall or make dozens of ads between every click! This means you can do fairly quick work, especially once you have got the hang of it and can go through a routine of fundamental things you apply. The AI functions are better than any website AI apps i tried. Sometimes you have to try different wordings, the AI seems to understand very literally and you have to re-write it for it to understand what you mean. It seems to learn as you go along, idk if that’s me imagining it but when you “regenerate” it seems like it is thinking “hmm, that wasn’t it, try this?” And so on until you get it. If that is the case then that’s really cool. Also have found that sometimes it might make something, like a foot you are adding, too big proportionate to the body, but if you edit the prompt and write “make it fit proportionately” it will usually get the right one, don’t give up on the first try is what i’m saying. I have genuinely found this app to be very enjoyable and enhancing my art work and the creative process and experience. I’m sorry for never giving a review until now but i feel ready to praise and recommend this app now and i have turned several other people on to it after they were impressed with some of my work. Thank you.",

You can’t try out an actual cleaning by “AI Cleaner” since doesn’t appear to have any actual cleaning ability. Instead you get various web pages or advertisements for questionable quality and security - definitely not something I was going to click through to explore. \n\nThe “subscription” were also questionable. 7 days free then $9.99/week or the monthly cost of  $2.99/month billed annually for $34.99. The program doesn’t tell you what you can do as far as cleaning unless you pick one of the two options. They claim a 100% refund if you’re not satisfied. I wasn’t willing to go further since I didn’t feel like parting with that cost potentially with no refund. All in all there are much better apps in the store with much lower prices and not a spammy questionable interface.Stay Away!!",

        "內容": "I did a lot of research on which app would be the best to take notes for my classes on my ipad. As a Pre-Med student, all of the classes I have to take I have to retain the information for Med school. This app is the most organized note taking app I tried (Free form, good notes, apple journals, etc.) Having all of my class notes in one spot and not collecting a thick heavy spiral every semester is so nice and convenient. You can download your lecture slides as a pdf and then share it to add it to your notes in Notability to then annotate directly on the slides or pdf your prof. gave you. You do have to get the annual subscription for the total benefits, but i think $15-18 ish dollars once a year is completely worth it, plus Notability has the cheapest subscription plan I could find. I recommend this app to everyone who wants to be able to make clean and neat notes with straight lines, perfect shapes (LOVED this feature for organic chemistry), and unlimited colors, writing utensils, and thickness of the ink. The best new feature has helped me a lot, where they use AI and take your notes you have written (or imported as a pdf or slides) and you can summarize all of your notes, and even make AI generated practice questions and quizzes! This helped me a lot with cramming for finals teehee. There are a lot of customization options in every aspect of your notes (page color, line sizes, lines, graph paper, music staff paper, color ink, ink thickness, crayon, sticky notes, highlighter, etc) Anyways, excuse the essay, but I highly recommend this app to someone wanting to switch to electronic notes!!!🤍🫶🏻",

Sometimes the pencil doesn’t work even though I selected it. These are very recent problems and it is making it difficult to use notability now. \n\nBesides these new issues I’ve loved notability so much, it’s perfect for me as a student but these recent issues are hindering the things I need to do as a student. \n\nSome suggestions:\n- be able to have multiple folders within subjects for more organization \n- make the text feature more user friendly \n- add a feature to choose if you would like notability to automatically delete blank notes \n\nI am so grateful for notability and I hope these new issues I have will be resolved soon since they create problems for me as I am writing notes and completing assignments in notability for classes as a student.",

However, after around the second year I used it (once I was committed and all my notes were saved in the app), it started performing horrendously.  I use the app on my phone, Mac, and iPad.  None of the notes ever sync up, and now it almost never allows me to open notes on my iPad at all.  I just get a consistent loading sign, essentially locking me out of many of my notes at once.  This will occur for days at a time. This causes me to entirely lose access to the ability to annotate/handwrite on any of my saved notes— which was my primary reason for purchasing this app.  Multiple times, I had all my edits deleted, as they failed to save, losing significant amounts of work.  The app crashes constantly and fails in its reliability. I have never written a review for an app but I wanted to warn all users before it is too late for them— please make the switch to a functioning notes app.",

But after just a few hours of use, it stopped me in my tracks.\n\nI was in the middle of taking notes during an important lecture when the app suddenly switched to read-only mode. Imagine this: I’m frantically trying to keep up with the professor, writing down key points, and then—bam!—the app refuses to let me type or annotate anything. Instead, I was left staring at my half-finished notes, completely helpless.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a glitch, but no. Apparently, I’d hit some kind of usage limit after only a few hours, and the app locked me out of editing unless I subscribed to their premium plan. There was no warning, no grace period, and no way to continue taking notes without paying up.\n\nThis threw my entire week into chaos. I missed out on notes for multiple classes while scrambling to find an alternative app. I felt blindsided and frustrated—if I’d known this would happen, I never would have relied on Notability in the first place.\n\nIf you’re considering downloading Notability, be warned: the free version is basically a trap. It lures you in, gets you comfortable, and then blocks you from using key features unless you fork over money. Save yourself the stress and find an app that doesn’t pull stunts like this.",

        "內容": "I used Notability to help me through nursing school. I paid for the subscription during nursing school and it was well worth the money. I created folders for each class & stayed highly organized. I used a keyboard attached to my iPad to type notes and used the highlighters and color functions to help make my notes easy to read. I also liked that I could upload PowerPoints to the app & use a stylus on my iPad to write notes. I was a nursing tutor and I always recommended people check out notability for free to see if they would like it.",

I chose it over other note apps because of all the features and how user friendly the design is,etc. Ever since a few months ago at least, it has been crashing every day! I am not sure why but it still has not been fixed which is frustrating. I use it on my Mac and my iPad and the iCloud sync features could be improved as well. The documents take a long time to show up on the other device, or not at all. Again, great app but it needs some bug fixes majorly",

        "內容": "In the middle of taking notes for my lecture today I got a notice that I had “reached my editing limit”for the day and was put into read only mode and when I tried to create a new one a subscription menu pops up instead… So apparently once I write enough in one document I get locked out and can’t create a new page at all, and if I want to continue writing my notes I have to pay for a subscription. I couldn’t take notes for the rest of my lecture and I missed some parts because I was panicking trying to figure out why I couldn’t write anymore. Notability used to stand out for its availability and the fact you didn’t have to pay to use basic features, I know that’s why I downloaded it and have used it for so long but this new update means I now have to find another app to use because I don’t have the spare money to pay for a subscription as I’m in college which is really disappointing and just adds more work to my plate since I have to now move ALL my notes over into another app.",

I’ve used it for so many things - from scanning & sending a copy of medical & ID cards to help an elderly relative to scanning & filing old family recipes. I like that it allows me to create PDFs and other file formats. I appreciate the ability to edit things I’ve scanned (including “erasing” fingers & thumbs that I inadvertently captured recent in a scan).  I’m sure it can do even more amazing things - I haven’t had the opportunity to fully explore the app’s capabilities. But what I have seen and used - I am very pleased with.",

I still use windows 7 with Microsoft picture it for my editing for goodness sake! But I have played with youcam perfect and loved it!  I created a lot of really fun things.  I recently download just the ai youcam pro and found that I can finally create caricatures!  I have the pro version of several youcam apps and truly the key to it is practice and repetition, just like any other craft.  I had to learn to refine my ai prompts several times to obtain my desired results, but I’m learning how to word things.  I have found the youcam line of products, while powerful, are fairly easy to learn if you are persistent and determined.  I think the $40 a year is a fair price for the power of this app!

        "內容": "I would have rated this a 4 or 5, but I give it a 2 because you can only generate 2 pics a day unless you buy pro. The only purchase options are monthly or yearly subscription models which are the worst. I stop using apps that only offer a subscription. If a 1 time purchase option is offered then I’d change my rating. There are so many AI art apps on the App Store right now that it’s over saturated. So many other apps offer a lot more for free than this app does. Some of them have way better art styles and a lot more art styles that aren’t just for pro users who pay. They also offer way more images generated per day and options to watch ads to collect credits to generate more images or remove the watermark. Do yourself a favor and use Starry AI instead of this app until it is updated to offer a 1 time purchase and better art options.",

I get an “inappropriate” content warning 99% of the time even if it’s just a hairstyle on a face I’m trying to extend. Worse than that, they removed several of my favorite Styles (zombie, horror, sci-fi, etc) and added Jade and Clay?! So, my dazzling new style choices are to turn everything green or make it mud.?\n\n…Yass! They brought back the Horror styles boosted my rating back up.",

I’d love a fair fight but they cut my space too short. That’s fear. Their primary argument is about scientific consensus. I’ll put Michael Crichton’s speech on that topic up against these programmers any day of the week. It reminds me of the fear on college campuses these days.  Global warming has all the marks of a religion that rejects questioning the tenets of a very flawed theory whose supporters know their careers depend on spouting support for the popular thesis, regardless of significant holes. If they question the orthodoxy, their funding sources dry up. Why are scientists whose work receives funding from a pharmaceutical company or the like, required to report that potential bias, but those whose entire careers depend on their allegiance to CC/GW and its vast sources of funding not also required to report that obvious bias?",

        "內容": "I initially went from free version to premium, as it did a fantastic job recovering and restoring blurry pictures. It worked like magic in the beginning, giving excellent results every time. However, over time, the app has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The performance has decayed significantly, with the quality of restoration becoming mediocre at best. To make matters worse, they are now pushing users to go \"Pro\" and charging more money for features that were once available in the premium version. It feels like they’re asking us to pay more for the same functionality that worked perfectly in the past. This has been a frustrating experience, and I can no longer recommend the app in its current state.",

If you’re gonna let people use this for free, at least take away the watermark. It reduces our freedom in quality content, and I would kindly like it if it were to be removed. Thank you.",

I got a message saying I was the new owner of my friend’s clan. I was so confused I asked him why he gave me his clan. He said something that stuck with me and made me quit 2 days after. “The commitment is too much, winning and being at the top feels good but not fun anymore. I want to spend time with my family. Thank you for being my friend.” I realized how much time I committed to the game the next day and quit cold turkey. The concept is great, battle chess is fun. I love this game but cannot play it anymore. It’s very addictive, play in moderation, don’t get obsessed with ranked.",

The designs are amazing storyline is a bit confusing but overall a great game..unfortunately I’ve seen most of the characters costumes are starting to come out as packages for you to buy with real money. Usually after playing a game for so long I’d be willing to buy such outfits at a reasonable price but the prices for these costumes are 25-35 dollars for the 1st “cheaper” package. Before, we use to be able to get the costumes after grinding in the arenas..now I don’t get to have the joy of a new outfit I worked hard for…hoping they bring the in game currency costumes back as well as some more ftp things for poor players… 😞🙏",

        "內容": "This game feels like a relic, even though it launched in 2017, but I dig those vibes. \n\nThe game is very generous towards new players and has lots of systems that are fun to interact with. Are they systems designed to drain you of your cash? Yes, but at least they did a good job designing it. \n\nHowever it’s not the best experience. The story is ok, I personally have been having difficulty connecting with it; probably because of how it’s presented, very static cutscenes in between battles which aren’t super engaging to begin with.\n\nIn that note, yes strategy is involved in setting up your units, you can get very technical about it, but after that you just watch them, combat is automatic and you get no input, it’s not very dynamic.\n\nIt does have the benefit of being an older game, which means there’s lots to do, but most of it you have to slog through.\n\nMaybe if this game out in 2010 I wouldn’t be so harsh on it, but even when this game came out there were better mobile games out there, and there still are.\n\nFortunately they have a sequel that’s pretty good, even if it does crash a lot. You don’t need to play this to play that, go try Brown Dust 2.",

The artwork is amazing and the amount of characters is nice as well. As a f2p player you can get lots of gems and materials from doing normal weeklies and events that will allow you to pull many characters. So as an f2p definitely worth giving it a shot. \n\nThe only reason i didn’t give it a 5 star is that while they do make a good amount of content somewhat regularly it can get very repetitive after playing the game for months on end and for that reason I ended up taking many breaks from the game. But in the end this is one of the only games that I keep coming back too.",

Certain editing features, filters and capturing modes are behind a paywall now. I get the idea behind a membership, especially with the immense amount of filters offered and for more serious photo artists. However, a part of the apps appeal was the easy access to a wider variety photo editing capabilities as opposed to Adobe or the more expensive options. Having to pay to post videos and boomerangs? That’s also really odd considering that no other app has you pay to post either of those since they are so widespread and basic features on every social media app. Locking basic editing features? Definitely interesting. I still love using the app to gain inspo and save memories though.",

Do not waste your money on an annual membership if there is any chance you may switch from apple to android or vice versa. The annual membership is not transferable, even if you paid for it just a month  before. In addition, you have to wait until the previous membership runs out to get a new annual membership  or make a new account. Which,  by the way, costs $30 more for Apple then it does on android for the same features. In addition, their support is close to worthless. They seem to only skim messages, not really analyzing the content at all and only use a set of pre-canned phrases to reply. I’ve been a loyal VSCO user for several years, but can’t see myself paying for a  membership ever again.",

Regardless of my phone, now with the best available, it’s the same problems and yet they want even more money, and are offering less features (of the same style and caliber) as other apps that cost less or the same. The quality has really dropped off hard. If my work is randomly going to go missing, the app lacks features and functionality of others, has the same type of film styles as others, I’m not sticking around. I’ve used this app for many years, and before it, had all the sets for Lightroom. It’s just not the same and it’s not worth it. I am tired of missing images, lost work and time, and tired of constantly having to restore my subscription. It’s just not keeping up with others providing better editing services of the exact same style. Sad.",

However, for the amount of money I pay yearly for Pro, it doesn’t feel like the app functions in a way that’s even worth it anymore. When I’m editing pictures in studio, as compared to after I post them, some of the color and textures are different. It’s like all the work I put in to make my photos look exactly how I want, is all for nothing and it’s frustrating. Another thing is, is after you post it, the quality of the original photo is significantly reduced. I even tried VSCO on desktop to see if it helped, and it was actually worse quality. Also, this is the biggest thing that genuinely kind of makes me angry, is after I post my photos,  for some reason on select photos, it’ll add a white bar to the side of my photos. It ruins my feed and it ruins the quality and the aesthetic of my work. It literally makes no sense to me and I’ve tried everything to try and prevent it. The app crashes a lot as well, sometimes when I’m editing in studio and all the (sometimes hours) of work is gone and I have to restart. It’s a shame because there is really no other app like this out there and it doesn’t seem like I’ll be straying away from posting, but I also think the artists on this app deserve better. For me, and I’m sure for a lot of others, it brings me intense joy to see my work displayed beautifully. It brings me joy to edit and make art, especially with all the beautiful functions of pro. It’s something I’m extremely proud of (my profile and work) I just wish you guys would improve the overall quality of the app. I know you guys value us as artists, there’s just a lot of bugs and unnecessary glitches that have yet to be fixed, especially when you have subscriptions options where people are paying YOU guys for ‘pro,’ it shouldn’t be happening. Please, please, do better.",

I’m hoping that someone can reach out and fix this problem but it appears it is challenging to solve as a design. Poor customer service, even worse response rates.",

Right now I have tried to import a photo about 10 times and it simply will not show up in the editing bay. Getting really frustrated with this app that I've been using for years and years. The filters are good, but the functionality is awful.",

        "內容": "I am a birth worker who offers complimentary birth photography to my clients. I decided to use VSCO to edit photos for a client and signed up for their 7-day trial to use Pro. After the trial, I paid for a one-year subscription.\n\nThe VERY NEXT DAY, I tried logging in but kept getting a message that my password was wrong (which is impossible because I saved it to Chrome), but I went ahead and tried resetting the password. After several attempts, I never receive a link to reset my password. Hours go by and still no link to reset my password. I checked and searched my entire business email inbox.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is my profile was flagged by a bot as having illicit photos, even though my photography is modest and doesn't show any compromising photos of my client or her newborn.\n\nI'm not a moron either and obviously made sure not to post any photos to the community tab, so I have no idea why VSCO would kick me out after taking my money and never explaining why.\n\nI opened a support ticket (it hasn't been 24 hours yet, so haven't heard back), but I'm thinking of just going to my bank and disputing the charge and just getting rid of VSCO and actively advocating against VSCO to everyone I know. It's absolutely insane that birth photography would be flagged.",

Ad nauseam. \n\nLastly, performance is abysmal. With the most powerful iPhone 16 Pro, it loads photos to edit like a Window machine in ‘95 opening Photoshop. Can’t imagine why when more powerful editing tools load instantly.",

This app just isn't what it used to be and definitely isn't worth the expensive subscription. Everything I can do on here editing wise I can just do using my Iphone's photo editing feature and using Ibispaint \"noise\" filter for the grainy effect.

When i finally got the keyboard, i wanted to text my friends to try put these fonts, so i clicked on them, and i could only use about 3 out of at least 23 or more. I am not happy with this app at all. It is a scam. If you want better luck with fonts, then go to the app: FaceEmoji.

But the thing I wanted to warn you about is the themes. When you want to download a theme for your phone, you choose one and what will pop up is a page saying you have to watch 3 adds to unlock it. And if you do, then after the adds will be a screen asking you to select the icons you want to change to match the backround/wallpaper. After you select the ones you want to change, there will be a button saying to install all icons or something, you will know it when you see it. DO NOT PRESS THIS BUTTON!!! It will make you pay for it. And if you press the two buttons at the top of the screen, it will just save the backround photos to your camera roll. Only download this app if it is worthit. Thank you for reading and have a great day!😁💖",

So I paid the subscription, finished up an animation and... can't export. I tried deleteing some arrows, erasing some selections, no luck. I opened a new image and tried to export it without any alterations. Won't work. I feel like the guy in real fake doors.

All of this app’s AI-created people look like those illustrations, except full color this time instead of just creepy pencil drawings. Anything I ask it for comes back with people that look like they got pulled out of a burning car. I’ve tried rewording things. I’ve been specific. I’ve been non-specific. I’ve been patient. I’ve prayed over it, and I mean I’ve actually pleaded with God to accept the souls of the AI creations I’ve made with this app as I’ve swiped past them, because I feel guilty for bringing them into their brief and tortured existence. Seriously, this was not ready to be unleashed onto the public. OR: you guys could repackage this thing, exactly like it is, as a horror-themed AI-image creator. Any prompt returns something scary, no matter how innocent you try to make it. You just don’t tell anybody you made it by accident, and start raking it in. Jumpscare by Lightleaks.",

You want to export? Sorry, you cannot actually save your work. It'll cancel but will look really nice in the app itself. You wanna share it to any other platform? Sorry it HAS to stay in this app. \n\nI pay to have the best quality monthly. So for 10 dollars a month I may or may not be able to save my work. What an absolute steal. \n\nThis devs need to fix this issue or at the very least help figure out a work around as to why the product isn't working as it should. I have scoured the internet with every last bit of support to figure out why I cannot export. I deleted and reinstalled. I deleted all the projects I previously opened. I duplicated the project many times in hopes the export function will work. How am I supposed to save my project to my device?",

I lost all of this art including their Timelapse’s because I had not been able to save all of my pieces since backing it up was hidden behind a paywall, aka 3 dollars a month or 30 dollars a year. I lost some of my best pieces and I am beyond upset because I couldn’t recover them once I finally bought a new tablet. The app itself and its functions work very well for something that’s free, but I absolutely despise the fact you have to pay to back up art you’ve made.",

I tried the app a while ago, but stopped using it due to its poor export compression. Just recently checked out the app again because the features were just that good, and it seems like the almost fixed the compression issues. The picture quality on all of the templates (except for PicStrip and LongPic) is now pretty good. Combined with the robust tools, this would be the best app I’ve used so far... except for the compression quality on those two templates. 一一一一一一一一一一一一一一 2.8.5 version 希望能提供高象素存储选择 设计风格、颜色、排版无可挑剔，赞一个！唯一不满意的是存储象素太低（即使选择了高清），画质损失太大以至于我改用了别的app，即使它没有我喜欢的颜色和排版，因为背景、颜色再漂亮也没有照片中人物清晰来得重要。",

This app is a completely scan and it also usually these math games don’t have any ads, but it says only if you pay you don’t have to have.ads you probably do not want to get this app this is the best game, ever clap clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap this is so nice. It helps you understand your problems. It gives you tools and you get artificial intelligence, but to talk to you about how you can do this or what you need to prove and they also talk to like yourself. What do you have in mind? I don’t just give away everything and it’s also nice that the tall is very helpful too and this is like the best game ever. Please download it and give a good review like me.",

I wanted to hear from the developers on this. Are there any issues regarding an interruption in the session?\n\nThis app is wonderful. I have used it several times for various conversations and it performs flawlessly. It also transcribes heavy accents better than I can hear them, which is very helpful.

After using it for several days, I only found a single error; and that was almost certainly due to a mispronunciation by the speaker. The accuracy is almost eerie. \n I was surprised, and then astonished, to find the transcriptions are not word-for-word. (It would not be useful for preserving an exact courtroom transcript for example.) Instead the app, seemingly through wizardry, edits away repetition and the stuttering and stammering inherent in normal speech. The result is a concise summary of the significant points addressed by the speaker without the excess verbiage. It is the perfect note taking device. Transcribe AI will even turn the copy into precise bullet points with a tap of the screen. The app would have relieved me of hours of editing notes every week when I attended college. \n\n WHAT FOLLOWS IS TRANSCRIBE AI’S ACTUAL TRANSCRIPTION OF MY ABOVE REVIEW: \n\n I downloaded Transcribe AI during a promotion.

I was surprised to discover that the transcriptions aren't word-for-word, but instead, the app edits out repetitive and stuttering speech. This creates a concise summary of the main points addressed by the speaker, eliminating unnecessary verbiage. It's the perfect tool for note-taking. With a simple tap, Transcribe AI can even convert the notes into precise bullet points. I wish I had this app back when I was in college, as it would have saved me countless hours of note-editing.",

So I would say beware if you try this app, because you’re likely going to get scammed like I was into buying it.",

I sent money to her friend, helped her buy Bitcoin, and bought her an Apple Store gift card.  Last night I found out that the photos she sent me was fake, stolen from someone else, Jimsook Castro.  I was deceived nearly two thousand dollars, the most angry thing is that she deceived my feelings, time and energy!\n\n I hope everyone must be careful of the liar here!  English name is Onita\n\n I hope this software can strictly censor the scammers above, especially the female scammers!\n\n What a bad luck!  !  !",

Doesn’t matter if you’re a VIP and can send messages if the other person is not VIP they can’t read your messages. Totally useless app that wants to make quick money before providing a good user friendly platform. If you don’t know how to do business. Learn from Tinder at least.

Controls are a little difficult and can make you feel dizzy/seasick as someone else mentioned. Would love for there to be a paid version that I could just buy, get rid of all the ads, and then maybe they would put more money into development. There should be things like timed challenges and a much faster pace. Then also things like once you find him then you need to get him somewhere. Maybe there is more at higher levels but after level 5 I'm just too bored to go on.",

And there's a lot of extremely violent and sexual advertising. It is built into the game. \n\nThere's a little wrapped present sitting on the main screen. You can can click on, to watch a video, leading more points. Those videos have a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger style violence and very sexualized women barely dressed, mostly in underclothes and bikinis. \n\nI've had to stop my girls from playing. Which is too bad because it's such a cute app. \n\nMy original app review: \n\n\"My kindergarten and second grader love this. Cute, age appropriate and self-explanatory.\n\nMoving around the room is a bit awkward, and takes a little bit of getting used to. \n\nBut thats a fairly minor complaint. \n\nI'm giving it five stars because are really enjoying it. I would highly recommend it for someone who's got kindergarten or older kids who's looking for for non-violent or explicit game.\" \n\nI'm no longer recommend this for young kids, solely because of the advertising.",

I love the cute chubby Ojipockle and their descriptions. \n\nIt's a really great relaxing game! I also appreciate that this game can be played 100% offline which is awesome! Also there is \"My Ojipockle\" which looks like an expansion of this game where you can raise a baby Ojipockle and decorate its room and explore more areas of the house like bathroom and kitchen etc. and play mini-games! Both games from this developer is great!",

        "內容": "This is a beautiful, well designed game that's ideal for killing time. Contrary to the complaints of other reviewers, I don't think the controls are too cumbersome. You are a Japanese university student named Sara(???) who is tasked to assault the adorable \"Ojipockles\" (old man fairies) who occupy her small flat with  bottle of \"fairy water\", whereupon they will burst into hearts, which eventually allow you to level up and assault more Ojipockles in different outfits. Yeah, I don't get it either. \n\nThis game is super addicting but I wish there were slightly more plot development here. Because the prologue was handled so beautifully, I had really been looking forward to more cutscenes with dialogue or something. After getting to level 13 of 36, I'm starting to feel like there's aren't many incentives to look forward to beyond viewing new Oji designs. The gameplay is also so simple that I'd actually like it if it more challenges were thrown at me. There's really no way to \"lose,\" or even be set back a little. No enemies, no time limits, no chasing.\n\nAll that said, this is still pretty incredible for a free mobile game. The concept is fun, entertaining and it's visually pleasing.",

        "內容": "There are way too many choices for all the different variants of this app — dozens of choices. I don’t like that because they don’t explain anything about what you are getting with each choice, and the prices are all different. Can you please tell me where to find a copy good description for each of the optional variants?? I went to the website for the developer and there is no help there. The descriptions are very, very brief and not informative at all. ≡≡≡ I have tested this app versus the actual ChatGPT-4o app from the actual original developer OpenAI. Those answers are always better than this app but OpenAI charges $20 per month, vs. $49 per year for this app from Failane.. FAIL-Ain? ||| ≡≡≡ ||| OpenAI gives you five or six queries per day for free, when I run out of those I jump over here to this one to get answers that are almost as good as the OpenAI app itself but 10x cheaper here.",

I did not purchase a WEEKLY subscription to your service or any other subscription while I was in the hospital. I cannot obtain a refund thru reporting a problem so I will leave a one star review and I wish it could be negative stars. Cease and desist with this subscription and do not try sneak it in under another one of your apps! $6.99 a WEEK is an outrageous amount for this service.",

I can’t have a cat because I’m allergic, but this game lets me see adorable cats everyday without having to actually buy a cat. I have to admit the only problem is now I want a cat even more than when I bought this game lol. I am also surprised by the fact that (as far as I know) there is no bugs! Most games you would expect to have at least a few glitches but I haven’t found any! The other question I know you all are asking, “is there ads?”. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game is not one of those games that have a ad every. Single. Level. This game has no ads disturbing the main gameplay. The only ads are for if u want to do things like double your rewards or get a small reward in the store. This game is so fun and satisfying I couldn’t recommend it more for cat lovers like me.",

        "內容": "Never trust an app that makes you pay to try it out. Experience tells you they are seldom worth even one penny of your money, this one is no exception. Thankfully, there are smart ways around the ones that try to force you to pay up front. And thankfully,\nThis allowed me to see for myself that this app isn’t worth the time you likely wasted just watching the advertisement that probably lead you straight to their reviews section to see if it was worth the one week trial for $6.99. Short answer, it’s not. Your pics are left looking like a two year old took a photo of you using bad Snapchat filters and then over edited\nthe living crap out of them in a bootlegged photoshop program with the half eaten crayon brush. Save yourself the time and the money and don’t listen to the positive reviews you see here. They’re all bought and paid for by the app developer in hopes that they will earn him a few extra bucks made off of the gullible and bored amongst you. It’s all bad marketing geared towards taking your money and leaving you with a poorly executed application that doesn’t deliver on its promise to make you look like the next big instagram sensation or whatever. You’re better off sticking with Snapchat or using any other photo editing app like Airbrush or Picsart. Or just be comfortable enough in your own skin to embrace your imperfections and spare yourself the countless hours most others otherwise waste trying to convince the world they are something they will never be. Either way, do your wallet the favor and delete this crap app. You can do better.",

It was an atrocious video. And I was not able to make anything else without the app telling me that I had to pay an annual fee of $29.99. So much for a three day trial.

        "內容": "I rely on this app for my business. Please help! This app has been by far my favorite photo editing app for so many years! I use it every single week, for my family and my business. I even use it for very simple animations, believe it for not. I feel like I couldn’t live without it, and this would have been a five star review if it wasn’t for the recent chances in the last day or so. Please bring back the names of the filters, frames, and overlays! You have no idea how much easier they make it to use! Not to mention the personality it gives it. And it seems like you got rid of filters and switched the order of a few things. Please put it back. I don’t usually get emotional about these kinds of things, but I’ve probably had this app since it first came out many years ago, and it’s like an old friend. It’s seen my kids grow up. It’s made art out of the photos of pets who have passed away. It’s helped me restore old damaged family pictures. I would love to have it be something I can still use to the same capacity. I will tell everyone I know to download it if you please just fix it. UPDATE: as of 1/18/2025 I can’t even open the app now. It just crashes over and over. What did you guys do to this? It was perfect for years! Please fix this and put it back the way it was for the last decade!!! 😭😭😭",

It is so much harder to navigate without the names.

Then I have to remember exactly where I found the effects without the use of any keywords or names to guide me. Please please please bring back the names.

        "內容": "0 Stars if I could!!\nThough I’m in my 40s, I’m very tech savvy. I’m the one who fixes my family’s phones, etc, & I run a side business on my phone, including the contact info of 100s of clients.\n\nIn an effort to clear some storage space on my phone, I researched various cleaning apps to find the best one for my needs. This included looking at a number of reviews from 3rd party sources. I decided to try this app. I encountered the following problems:\n1- No instructions were given about how to use the app & how it would affect your phone.\n2- I asked it to merge repeated contacts. Weeks later, I am still finding contacts it erased entirely!!!\n3- I asked it to delete duplicate photos, NOT similar photos. It decided 3 pictures I took at a friend’s wedding were too similar & deleted them all! Luckily I know how to retrieve them. Otherwise I wouldn’t have any of those pictures.\n4- It erased my personal contact information despite there being only one entry in my contacts. I had to completely reset Siri because she didn’t know my home address or who my relatives were. \n5- The app erased my map settings. I use my GPS almost every day for work. Not because I don’t know where I am going, but to get from place to place efficiently. It’s hard for me to ask for directions to my home and other places I’ve marked when they no longer exist for the program to access.\n\nIn summary, I wouldn’t trust this app to help you in any way. All it did was cause me trouble. Of course, I deleted it, but I wonder how long I’m going to be fixing the things it screwed up. Hopefully this review will act as a warning for the next consumer & save them time & worry.",

Though it does take time to grow heroes, it never feels like a chore to do so and I often find myself returning to the game even after months or years of not playing. The game does have it’s flaws, yes, but I feel like they’re very easy to ignore and don’t subtract from the overall gameplay experience. Not a perfect game, but an excellent one nonetheless.",

I went into it one day and found that all those edits and genres were gone and were only left with popular, Holliday and one other. Not only did tons of genres and favorite edits disappear but the adds got way more frequent to the pint of driving me mad. It was an amazing app when I had to watch an add every time I saved an edit and there were tons of different genres to pick from but know that I have to watch an add ever time I get out of an edit and I can only pick of 3 genres it’s really not that great. CapCut completely overthrew it.",

Their colors for backgrounds are the best I have ever seen. I would, however, like to see the same developers come up with a ‘tile’ design, that allows you to rearrange your designs and create the seamless pattern from it. I see only one other one available (Pattern Maker), and it’s not good. It is very slow and not reliable. I think these folks would do it right, so please consider it!",

First off, I got this thinking all of the wallpapers and backgrounds were free but turns out that you have to pay for most of them. And the once you get the wallpaper that you want you don’t even get the back round or widgets and you have to set that up in settings which takes like five minutes. Plus, I’m in the free trial and after three days you have to pay 20.00 for one month automatically. And I get you have to make money some way but not everyone has that much money and it’s a lot over all. I hope you guys think about how much money we have to pay every year.",

It was certainly the best product on the market and worked very well (no disconnects) yet, over the past couple of years, we have seen little in the way of useful improvements, yet more and more chargeable features are appearing. Choose one model or the other, don’t charge people full price for the camera then cripple other features unless you pay a ransom.\n\nTo date we still use it as we did on day one… as a baby monitor, sat in plain view on the table in our lounge. It used to be perfectly reliable, and gave us some nice automated snapshots, but these days it often disconnects, or when we first load the app it says it cannot connect!? …and the wall seems to be crippled unless we pay for “ultimate”.\n\nThe camera is always connected to our router, and can be pinged, so it’s surely a software issue… plus, I see many other people having the same issues, which previously didn’t occur. Stop asking use to help you fix a problem that clearly isn’t an individual thing, it’s your deteriorating software.\n\nTLDR; The product now costs more in subscriptions, when we already pay a hefty price for the hardware… Also, fix the networking issues! My WiFi hasn’t changed, yet your camera now frequently refuses to ‘connect’!",

The lullaby feature is equally disappointing: there’s an extremely limited selection, and you can’t even play more than one track in sequence. If you want a change, you’re forced to manually switch it; otherwise, it just repeats the same lullaby endlessly. It feels like a cheap, hastily assembled attempt at technology, and the app is so slow and glitchy that it’s practically unusable.\n\nCuboAI feels like a total gimmick. The company seems to be more interested in profits than providing parents with a reliable, well-thought-out product. Anyone promoting this is either paid off or unaware of how poorly it performs. I wasted a considerable amount of money, and I think the company should honestly be ashamed of what they’re putting on the market. I wouldn’t recommend CuboAI to anyone.",

It is like having an extra set of eyes on your little one. The feature we love the most is the roll over/face covering. Makes sleep time worry free. It is pretty easy to set up and customize according to your needs and preferences. Please push in more updates frequently so that it keeps working smoothly and more efficient.",

Terribly frustrating, but to their credit, support responses have been quick.  \n\nWe’ve been using CuboAI for over 2.5 years now, as it was recommended to us when our first was born, and we’ve kept it for our second. Our first came early and we didn’t do much research, just took our friends recommendation and ran with it. In reading reviews now, and after using the app, I can’t say I strongly recommend it. Like many have previously stated, reliability is a huge issue. We’ve had it crash on us overnight several times, but thankfully both my husband and I run the app so we usually still hear our daughter if/when she cries. This latest update (2.14.1) seemingly has a bug that’s rendered it useless for me, as the app noise won’t run in the background. Tried restarting phone and closed the app out to no avail. Can’t figure out how to revert to a previous version, so have to hope they release a fix soon. For now will be leaving my phone open and on all night. Finally frustrated me to the point of writing a review - beware!",

        "內容": "best budgeting app and ive tried TONS of them, including the fancy ones you pay for. it’s fun to add expenses and income because the interface is so cute, and its so simple to see how much $ you have compared to how much you’ve spent. \n\nWhen i downloaded the app, i made “paid” categories for available credit, debit balances, and cash on hand. That way, if I get behind on logging things, i can catch up by plugging in what i have at that moment, and adding a “paid” entry for the total amount of expenses i didnt keep track of. Then i can check the list and see my notes of what money came from where - for example, i can note that i spent $5 cash at 7/11, and $5 debit at the grocery store - and compare that to the balances i entered earlier. there isn’t any other app ive used that has that specific capability, and i don’t know why - I guess they try to overcomplicate things. \n\nI also love how there is 100% no judgment or messages or “tips” about budgeting or saving money. it’s a fun and simple account book! no guilt!!\n\none feature i’d like to see is a calculator in-app, that would be useful.\n\nFor people complaining about ads - its only $1 to remove them! you’ll forget about that $1 immediately. App developers need to make money somehow!",

I’ve fallen in love with the little happy foods! I also like visiting Happy village. You can get ingredients from there, and there is also a happy restaurant you can serve the foods you have made to characters who come into the restaurant. But something that can be improved is more free recipes. I want to keep cooking new things. The 3 step mini recipes are not fun because it finishes in 10 seconds and you barely get to do anything. After all, this game is amazing and I will probably never stop playing!",

But since I can’t download the original game, I had to download this version, While I downloaded it random things just started popping up in my screen and it was really confusing. I also HATE how you have to watch ads for some gifts. And also they make you have an entire restaurant. + It’s also really loud and disruptive too, I suggest that they should lower the volume down. I also don’t like how you have to get a certain amount of level in the game, so you could unlock a new recipe. Please remove that part from the game. I’m only giving this 2 stars because atleast this was a free game to download. Overall, I would probably give this game a 1 star rating/review.",

Do you wanna buy this and I said no so I went into my mom and she just deleted it. The second my second complaint is the second time I played it and got it again. It would let me play it and I was super happy but I didn’t really like it. The animation scares me. The third complaint that I have is if a four year-old went to go play this they get so creeped out about when you finish something she says you’re better than CookingMama And that creeps me out and I’m almost 10. That’s ridiculous. I am using the microphone so I don’t care if my words are messed up that’s because your game is messed up. But buy you know why I said buy like that is because you have too much stuff that people are not going to buy",

We all know there’s no possible way to play an app without really bad annoying ads every ten seconds. This game doesn’t have too many but when they do pop up they are at least one minute and unskippable. Once the ad ends every time it tries to make you touch the screen and “play” a demo for at least thirty seconds. Then you spend about fifteen more trying to get the ad to close and not open the App Store. I close the app every time. I’m not waiting for that.",

Some times the game freezes or the controls are bugged as well. Other then that this game is very entertaining and I love how the game doesn’t show ads every second (ads can be chosen to watch to earn points, etc., but there are ads every 10-20 minutes). Also if you are still deciding on getting the game depending on what you like & not like, then let me explain a little about some things a persons traits/personality have to enjoy this game. If you enjoy cooking then you will enjoy this game a ton, I also noticed that this game can take a lot of patience so if you have no patience whatsoever, maybe stick to keeping this game out your phone. In conclusion, this game is pretty much made for everyone except for the people that have no patience (explained above). Game is amazing, please check it out!!!",

Too much! Then, a couple days later, I opened it again. 30 is not an advanced age, but it's enough to feel the difference between Cooking Mama as I knew it, and Cooking Mama as it is now. \n\nTo those who are seeking the classic Cooking Mama experience: it is here! Simply ignore everything but the Kitchen, and you will be happy. \n\nTo those looking for more idle game opportunities, and other aging Millennials: recall those activity center CD-roms, or Flash game websites. The rest of this app recalls those times. The Happy Village contains a fishing mini-game; the Challenge area contains many more mini-games; you can decorate your finished recipes with stickers, etc.\n\nI've been enjoying my time with Cooking Mama. With no money spent, you'll get about 1:30-2:00 of daily content with this game, and most of that is idle time. Desk workers will enjoy it. \nGive it a try!",

I was sad because I was excited after the voice tests and such. I wish it would let you at least have a few songs you could sing without subscribing. If I tried that, and it worked good, I would definitely consider subscribing. But if I haven’t had a chance to, then I won’t miss not having it.",

You can’t customize your profile, you can’t choose specific songs you want to sing unless someone else has done a duet for it, and like i said previously you can’t sing by yourself. There’s no fun in it unless you spend money.",

But anyway, I’ve been using this a long time and really enjoy it, quality is great and I love how easy it is to join people and go back to fix a part when you’re in the middle of a song and adjust your volume and such. I do wish they would get rid of or extend the 100 display songs. I also recommend a forward and rewind button of 5 seconds to 15 seconds- I feel like that would be super productive to add when we’re replaying songs, as sometimes it’s a hassle to manually go back :) Otherwise, amazing and I love love 🔥🩷",

Smule is pretty good because they have a nice song library and many of the songs have a pitch guide to follow as you are singing. The main problem is that I like to “sing along” and not just sing by myself. I don’t want to sing with real people that can hear me, so I’d never join a group. I only let the people at my house hear me singing. I would NEVER post a video of me singing. I just wish I could follow along with the lead vocals of the songs. Smule should offer hearing the words to the song along with seeing the lyrics and having the pitch guide while singing. It would also be fun to be awarded stars after singing (just like rock band.) Karafun is meh too. I can hear the words, which is wonderful, but they don’t offer a pitch guide to follow as I’m singing. Even though I’m a bad singer, I still like to see how close I am to the correct note. I need these two apps to merge together. Just my rant…",

I downloaded it without reading the reviews, which was a HORRIBLE idea. \n\nThese are the horrible things of this app:\n \n⚪️ The subscription: \n So when you open the app, it tells you about a subscription. So when I got this subscription, I clicked the button to skip, but I couldn’t skip it. I tried a LOT of times until I finally skipped it. Also you need the subscription to try some stuff. For example, for the feature that shows which animal are you, you need the subscription when in the ads it said that all of it was free.\n\n⚪️ The ads: \nThe app is NOTHING like the ads. The ads that I got for this game showed that you could turn pictures of people into cartoons, which I thought was really cool, but you actually can’t do that in this app .  You can put some filters and there are also some features like which animal are you and there’s another one where you can change the color of your hair, but you cant do what the ad shows. \n\n⚪️ Conclusion: \nThis app is HORRIBLE. I do not recommend it at ALL. Also  please read the reviews before you download apps.\n\n⚪️ To the developer:\nIt has happened a lot of time since I have downloaded the app. Now is when I decided to write this review. I hope you have changed your app, but I don’t think so since I saw an ad in one of the games I have and it said things that aren’t in the game, so please be honest, STOP with this fake ads and make this app better.",

( you can tell where I’m going with this ) I saw an ad, and it said that this app could test which animal I was! I skipped the ad a few times, but the last time, I just gave in. What do you know, in the ad it didn’t even mention any subscriptions, but of course, you have to have a subscription to test which animal you are. I’m also perplexed however, because I can’t even get in without having a subscription. Complete outrage if you ask me. I mean seriously, you can’t just go around telling people things that aren’t true Willy Nilly to make yourself look good, that’s just wrong. So maybe the next ad you make, mention everything about your game instead of ‘still telling the truth’ but leaving everything else important out. Thank you! 😁",

After 1 week they had a new tank big and better then that box Spot lived in. He swam around seeming really happy. After 4 days though something broke. By a miracle Spot was alive, but now that something was broken Spot had to stay in the old box. He lived sad, but after 1 week it was fixed. Spot was so happy, but stopped eating. And after 5 weeks he died. Now that tank he was in (the big one) was just having bags and no water. However only after another 5 weeks the kid knew this Spot died.

I am not saying that it haves to be exactly like the ad but I mean make it alike. At least make to so little kids under 9 can work with it. I am ten so I understand the money but just don’t be money wanters because that is not helpful and everyone that has this app is going to delete if you guys don’t start marking some things free like I have to pay to have the filters witch I think is stupid.

The review, as brought to my attention, very kindly I might add by the poor developers I had written so horrendously about, was in fact for an entirely different application, NOT for Cool Fonts.\n\nI wish to apologize to all concerned for my horrendous mistake and hope no serious damage was done to the developing team or the application itself.\n\nI have deleted the review from the App Store but see that it's up. Hopefully it will disappear and be forgotten about as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely, A Ridgeway. Bermuda.",

The only down side is that you have to go little by little because when it’s so much files it kind of stops, but it also might be my internet. Very good app thanks a lot.",

At first, i didn’t use that which made the thumbnail weirdly stretched out and all the artists unknown, but after i started pairing mp3 tag and airmore to customize album art everything stayed pretty orderly. I use this app as my main music app now. The only problem is they have issues with the shuffle, but that’s pretty easy to overlook in my opinion",

BUT lately it keeps freezing my phone or the app itself freezes after 2 or 3 songs. Then I have to reload the app and then it says it has trouble synching to my libraries. It will play the whole song then just pauses itself. When u try to get into the app or press play it freezes my whole screen then it won't work until I again reload the app after it unfreezes hours later. Please fix this!!! This was one of my fav apps!!!",

Do I need to install a program on Win 10 to convert the format?\n\nRevised review Feb 2020\nRequested help on this issue by direct communication on help line and got the response to the effect “sorry it does not work for you”. I found the answer myself and now the app works pretty well. The Web offers “free” apps to convert HEIC to JPEG but I chose to pay $5.00 to Microsoft hoping that by doing so the photos on my camera would not be shared with anyone. The Microsoft sponsored app is a little cumbersome requiring some extra clicks but it does work and photos on my iPhone X are transferred to Win 10 computer in high resolution to the file of my choice AND can be erased from my phone with a confirmation click on the phone. \nThis system is better than transferring images via iCloud app on Win 10",

And once your finished watching one of the never ending ads, they will start the timer over again with a different ad. Ridiculous! That is why the score for this game is so low. You can’t play because there is literally an ad like every 3 minutes.",

        "內容": "I really enjoy this game, but there are WAY too many ADs. It’s annoying how an AD pops up randomly during the level / when you finish a level. There’s a button to “watch an ad” to gain extra points upon completing a level, but even just hitting “collect” (no AD) still causes an AD to pop up. The ADs are not convenient for split steaming. I’m often watching something else on my phone while I play, but can’t enjoy the game OR the show due to the game pausing my shows for an unwanted AD.",

Guess you’re never going to fix that. \nI only come back for the daily puzzles now. If I have time.\nI’m stuck advancing levels, I have to spend more time watching ads than playing the game.

        "內容": "To those who say you can’t listen while playing, it does that on my iPhone, too. \n\nIf I’m listening to something on YouTube or any other app, I have that playing and then I open the game app. Sound stops, but the little screen from what I’m playing pops up in the corner and I hit the play button. I listen while I play until an ad pops up. \n\nThe ad may or may not pause what I’m listening to. I listen to the ad. I hit the close button on the ad at the end of it and then hit play again on what I’m listening to. \n\nSome ads allow me to continue to listen, some ads don’t allow me. It’s super annoying that some ads stop me from listening but while I’m playing, I can listen to anything I want.\n\nI hope that helps. Maybe you all have a different experience than I’m understanding, but on my iPhone 15, I can listen to all the other apps I want while playing the game; YouTube, Netflix, Max, Apple Podcasts, Hulu , Apple TV, all of them. \n\nThe ads are waaaay too long and there’s an add in the middle of your game that gives you more points. There’s an add between games that gives you more points. So lots of ads but they give you points. And you have the option to just collect the points or to multiply them by whatever you click on when the little thingy goes by a number. So points add up QUICKLY. And those points let you rearrange the board or pull your first match or to put your last icon thing back (legal cheating, lol). \n\nMake sure to click on the home daily cause you get the opportunity to get even more points. And do your daily for more points yet. Yes, ads but lots of points.",

Also if you type in the appointment description there is no autocorrect. The whole app will crash if you try to take a picture for the diary entry. Also the it’s impossible to scroll and navigate while writing a long diary entry because your keyboard will not minimize, covering half the screen not allowing you to see the bottom half of what you’ve written.

Then when I put tomatoes on his face it washed the derogatory makeup he applied on his skin off of his face. I'm not sure if the juices of the tomato made it do that but this game is racist.
