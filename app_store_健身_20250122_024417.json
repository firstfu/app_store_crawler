        "內容": "I used this app for a very long time but I just have to move on. It’s not working for me anymore. I have extremely irregular periods and this app is not suitable for tracking anything but the standard 7 day period. For one, if you try to make a period longer than a certain amount of days it simply says something along the lines of “your cycle cannot be longer than x days.” And there is no way to click out of this warning. Which is just unfair, because biologically, yes, it is possible for periods to go on for months at a time. I found a way around this warning and figured out how to make it longer but I still get warnings constantly from the app about how I’m “inputting my period incorrectly.” I’ve had to go through a million hoops to figure out how to get the app to let me put my irregular periods in. Instead of just selecting the days, I have to hit start cycle, stop cycle on every single individual day because it auto stops your period everyday after a certain number of days so I can’t just click start period and stop period when it ends, I have to come back every day to click start cycle again. I’ve had my period every other day for the last week and I’ve tried everything, there is physically no way to get the app to track your period if you’re having it 1 day on 1 day off for several days in a row. I simply don’t have the time or energy to monkey around with this app anymore trying to put my periods in because the app thinks that I’m inputting them incorrectly. I’m already exhausted everyday and I’d like to just be able to dedicate as little time as possible to tracking my periods. I’m spending 10+ minutes a day trying to get this app to work for me. It’s made for people who have regular length periods once a month, nothing more.",

This was extremely helpful in the beginning when we were tracking how many diapers he was going thru. Found out he wasn’t producing enough and we needed to supplement with formula. You can also see patterns of sleep with the graphs and that’s super helpful to start a sleep routine. Can’t recommend this app enough",

Super helpful that it can be updated by multiple devices, I’m easily able to log nursing, sleep, diaper changes, etc, with as much detail as I desire, all in an incredibly cute interface with fun graphics. The data visualization is well thought out and the UI is intuitive to interact with. Any time I think of something new I want to use the app for, the function is already there and more! For instance, I just discovered the iPhone widget this morning and my experience has been further elevated yet again. It is PURE JOY to use, both as a former UX/UI designer and a first time parent. I’m so glad I found this and will definitely recommend to all my friends.",

You can also get reminders about when it’s time to nurse again.  Love love love 💕",

Also even skipping the questions doesn’t save time because you still need to do it for every question. It takes 42 clicks just to get to a point to sample the app. Way too many. and that’s with skipping everything. Make an option to skip all. Terrible design",

You can take a picture and then put some calories but let’s say for example I took a picture of my latte. It states that it’s a coffee and puts some calories in there a coffee and a latte. There’s a bit of a difference in the calories. So it doesn’t really have a sophisticated database that it taps in or that you can manually enter the name of what you’re eating and then it gives somewhat accurate count of calories. So this part of the app I would not get excited about the rest is pretty good but to me this is a important part of using the app and getting greater results.",

Initially I was excited when I saw the food diary.  It doesn’t count the foods correctly. If you manually record foods it’ll be there to choose again. I wish the foods would be alphabetical and individual. There’s times when I’ll eat the same foods, but not in combination like I did previously. I don’t use this feature anymore because it’s inconvenient. The other features I still use regularly. When I went to leave a comment in the app it said I had to get another mailing app in order to submit the comment. Even after I got this additional app, it still did not work.

Those who are reading this, even if you cancel same day for the free trial they take their money. Do not get this app. REPLYING TO THEIR RESPONSE… I was very clear on what happened. Wasn’t even 24 hours and I cancelled… 3 DAYS LATER. 30$ WAS TAKEN OUT. I hope apple takes you off this platform!!!!!! I hope whoever reads this goes to a different app to use. Cause this one isn’t it. ALSO I did get my money back. Nice try.. REPLYING AGAIN to your response. I’m not sending you anything. It was free for 7 days, I canceled within 5 mins …and 3 DAYS later the money was taken out. It’s ridiculous, I feel apple should take you off their platform, and after reading other reviews (which I clearly should have) you did the same to them. I appreciate apple refunding my money and you should be ashamed of yourself. ONCE AGAIN IT WAS A 7 DAY FREE TRIAL AND THE MONEY WAS TAKEN OUT ON DAY 3 LATER AND I CANCELLED IT 5 MINS AFTER i DOWNLOADED. YOU ARE  A SCAM DO NOT WRITE ME AGAIN WITH YOUR BULLST**.  I don’t want your app if you gave it to me. Stop emailing me with your lies justifying your scam app.",

Granted, you might need to subscribe for premium to experience the same excitement. I do have an advice, when you install the app the first time, you have about 15mins opportunity to subscribe to premium for like 65%? off - that offer disappears afterward so I’d suggest you sign up quick. Anyway, this app has kept me motivated for over 3 weeks of IF I’ve done multiple challenges- I’ve even loss 5lbs! 👍",

I love this app because even if you don’t pay, it gives you reminders, clear instructions, and lets you do your 30 day workout. It also predicts exactly when you are going to get to your goal if you follow the plan that they provide for you. This app is the most skibidi workout app ever 🎀✊🏾❤️",

Then focus on that area more if you wanted to. I haven’t gotten the plan but I am sure of thinking about it. If you feel like workouts are to easy, then select hard mode and do multiple days. I really like how you have to progress more into the days to unlock them so you just don’t cheat the system (smart way how devs did their app). If you feel like doing a light but not too hard workout, then go easy mode. No matter what if you need to squeeze in a quick workout before or after work, then download this app. (Don’t have to buy the plan until you really like the app). I’m hoping that I can get abs by June! DOWNLOAD NOW FOR A WUCIK WORKOUT!!!",

BUT it is the biggest waste of money bc it rarely stays connected and you constantly have to deal w it freezing or having to press RESUME bc it has disconnected. I contacted them and they had the audacity to just blame it on me instead of dealing w the issue which is that their network is weak. Read other reviews online and you will see. How is it that my Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Strava can all simultaneously work and stay continuously connected during a hike, but the relive app doesn’t stay connected tot constantly freezes. How about when you disconnect and then find connection, you don’t make the user have to magically and psychically guess that it’s disconnected so they look at their phone and press resume? I will not be renewing and regret ever upgrading. Terrible!",

That means that someone who doesn’t have a mobile device can’t follow you or view your activities.  So if you have elderly or mobility-impaired folks that have no mobile devices, then they can’t follow your activities.  \n\nIt’s also not very intuitive to set up.  Nor can one expand the photos to see them better.\n\nI wouldn’t use it except to follow two friends backpacking journey.  Once they are done, the app will be removed from my device.

But unfortunately it had a single giant flaw that prevents it from being useful for my situation. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that there algorithm to group photos into “Moments” is pretty bad. Feeding it a 5 hour track with upwards of 250 photos, and it groups them into just 10 “Moments”. Rather than spacing them out closer to where the photos were actually taken, it tries to group them far too closely together and has many off by dozens of miles. I understand their logic of not needing to be super ultra accurate with photo location, but this goes way way too far into the oversimplified direction.\n\nTo make it worse, when you do add “Moments”, you have to manually add the location/time when they were taken. The app won’t just read that data off of the photos that you import, even though it would be so easy for it to do. All of that data is right there.\n\nThis big flaw of adding moments being an incredibly manual process, when it should be so easy to have automated, is the biggest disappointment of this app. It’s a shame, because if that were just fixed I would have subscribed in an instant.",

I wrote to them as soon as I was billed for the renewal to request immediate cancellation and a refund. Here’s their reply.\n\nHi there, \n\nAccording to our system, your subscription was not cancelled before the renewal. When you joined Plus, it was stated that the subscription will renew automatically unless you cancel it. We won't offer a refund on your Relive Plus subscription.\n\nYou will still retain access to Relive Plus until your current subscription period ends.\n\nSee you on the outside,\nJanie\n\n———————————-\n\nMost of the apps and services I subscribe to annually send a reminder prior to renewal. Relive did not.\n\nWe are “adulting” here; Responsible for reading the fine print of the EULA as well as accepting the consequences for failing to. It just feels like a money grab on their part.\n\nIn summary, I have no complaints with the app or its functionality, and the timeliness in their response to my refund was great.

Love the 3D route progress tracking. \nA few kinks still need to be ironed out and processing times for the video to be ready can be a bit long even with a subscription… sometimes the creation fails and needs to be submitted again but no loss of work occurs. \nI wish editing minor aspects of the video such as titles would not result in re-processing of the video. \nThe only other minor annoyance pertains to fact it’s not appear to be possible to replace/resubmit a video that was already added. I mistakenly submitted an unedited video and was later unable to replace it with the edited version of that video. I also could not upload a new copy of it and delete the old one…\nAgain, fantastic app though",

Now I have to fully open the app to see that information, instead of glancing at my widget on my Home Screen or Lock Screen. My Home Screen widget is now just a black box, and my Lock Screen widget disappeared completely. I hope they put out another update to fix this problem, and if they do, I’ll update this review!",

The only reason I have the app a 4 star is because I wish it had a feature to better track milk storage! I notice that the amount it off (honestly sometimes by operator error). I end up being able to freeze milk and I just wish there was a feature to add in when you do that! My only suggestion and then it would’ve been a 5 star review!!",

(2) comparison of today’s running total of sleep, eating, etc. to the previous day’s or an average running total. (It’s nice to know at midday if we’re on track for a good night’s sleep.)

Simple and quick. The blood pressure section works the same. The high low and normal along with the pie and line charts.  The ability to change the date range is easy.  14 day, 30, 60, 90 and custom. I also like the ability to put in info about any lab work I’ve had.  I find myself looking forward to the weekly message it provides. Giving updates on you glucose levels, blood pressure and every once in a while an estimated A1c. \n \nThe things I wish were better:  the weight section. The line chart has no way to adjust the max and minimum. Goes fro 0 to 400.  I’ve lost over 25 pounds but the chart looks like a straight horizontal line.  I don’t really care for the before/after breakfast lunch and dinner part because my schedule is always changing. \n\nOverall I really like this app. Most of the issues I have are really personal preferences.  If you need an app to log you glucose levels give this a try.  It works well especially if you’re keeping track of a lot of details.",

But since I first downloaded it, it has gone downhill so much that I could never spend as much time as I used to spend on it, due to the drop in quality. Every other pin on my page is a ad, and there is so much AI content on here. It’s so disappointing and it ruins the aesthetic and usability of the app. I was to see fun content and projects for me to take on and fanart and things I love, not an add for dog food or an Amazon product every other pin. It makes me hate using the app and I can’t stand it.",

Also, if I click on one ad, I get so many of them. Like I just clicked a hoodie ad and I got a whole page of hoodie ads. Adding on, if I add one pin related to idk strawberry smoothies, my next like 100 pins are strawberry smoothies. One last thing, sometimes there are pins in my for you pages for specific boards that have nothing to do with the board. Like a painting board page might have a pin that is a strawberry smoothie! Also there are a lot of repeat pins from people who repost. Like if they repost a video it just shows a big random triangle that is the play button. They don’t even give credit and it’s really annoying for people who r creators on Pinterest.",

        "內容": "I’ve been using Clue (and later the subscription) for 10 years now. It’s the best way to track my cycle. It was a validating resource across multiple healthcare provider conversations. Even before I joined the subscription, I loved the insights/explanations to better understand how I needed to track for accuracy. This app taught me a lot about my body; more than that, it helped me better understand what happens with my body throughout the cycle. The more you use it the better the accuracy. And honestly: my dedication to tracking and attention to detail has been honed because I’ve been using this app daily for a decade. \nI’ve tried using other trackers, before finding Clue and after, but none of them were as accurate or gave as many options as Clue. A massive win in Clue’s favor is the option to choose what you track. \nThe few times I’ve had issues with the app, the turnaround time for a response is quick, everyone is beyond lovely, and it makes me love the app even more. The woman owned and woman ran company is what drew me into the app - the love that is so easily identifiable throughout the regular and paid version is the reason I keep supporting. Their dedication to women’s health care is why I chose to switch to the paid subscription (about four or five years after I started using the app) and I did it simply to help the women behind the scenes. Women supporting women. And the articles that are available are educational and frankly more in-depth than most resources you could find at your OBGYN office for all stages your body may go through: menstruating, ovulating, pregnancy, perimenopause, etc. \nI never leave reviews on things (adhd probs). But I can’t tell you how many times I’ve written one for Clue in my head over the years. Instead the best review I’ve given has convincing several friends and strangers to download the app. I’ll talk off anyone’s ear about how much I love this app. All of this is my honest opinion after using it ten years straight and a bit of a love letter 😅🥰",

I went through the feedback option on the app and asked if they could add a dark mode and told them my reason. Within the same month they added the dark mode and communicate with me about my feedback multiple times throughout me waiting. I honestly didnt even expect a reply to my feedback but they made it happen. Im extremely happy to know they value and listening to the people that use clue. So again thank you support team ❤️.",

Every single thing you do makes a pop-up ad appear asking you to purchase something, and they hide the X button. And even worse, you can’t get rid of their twice-a-day pop up notifications asking you to buy the subscription. Then they got rid of so many things that used to be available and hid it behind a paywall. For an app on women’s health, hiding information and advice on health is absolutely shameful and anti-woman. So frustrated that I have to delete it now and start over with another app.",

I’m happy to be a paying member for such a useful app. It’s gotten so much better over the past couple years, with useful additions including tracking severity of symptoms and (finally!) having a field for daily notes. Most recently, I’m loving the new dark mode! Thank you so much for implementing this option!",

That was literally the reason I choose Clue several years ago. Now I can only choose from the standard ones. A hugely important aspect of my cycle is that my asthma comes and goes with different phases of it, and I used to be able to track this. Now I can’t. PLEASE bring back custom symptoms tags. And where did cervix tracking go? I was just learning to use that to tell where I was in my cycle, and you took that one away too. \nUPDATE: It’s so annoying how Clue asks me *every* time I open the app, as well as every time I complete tracking, if I want to upgrade to the paid version. No! I don’t! Can you ask less often, please? I know what to do if I ever want to upgrade; I don’t need it shoved in my face.",

        "內容": "I have been using Clue since I got my very first period at age 13, and am now a 22 year old woman. This app has been my absolute rock when it comes to period, symptoms, and sexual tracking. Now, they seem to only care about money. You used to be able to share your cycle with others, get your period analysis, and so much more, all which is very important for people struggling with medical issues like myself. Everything except marking when you are bleeding is locked behind a pricey subscription that I will never be paying. I understand they need to make revenue, but why is literally everything that made the app great no longer available to loyal users for years? It seemed to work for so long, so why not anymore? \n\nEvery 5 seconds, I receive an ad begging me to buy clue plus. The more I see it, the closer I get to switching apps. I have heard friends using a different app called Flow, which I am considering switching to at this point. I feel betrayed along with many other women, which is shown in the hundreds of reddit threads online of women sharing their travesties with this app since the new cash grabbing tactics. \n\nThe one question I have for this company- In app subscriptions are shown to be bought by only a very small percentage of users….. is the couple extra bucks worth ruining your reputation and betraying your most loyal users? I would much rather sit through A FEW ads each time I use the app than be tainted with constant money begging. \n\nUnder negative reviews, they are basically saying “don’t care, sorry!” You care about women and advocate for women to understand their bodies….. But only the women who can afford the ridiculously high cost of it? This company needs a serious reality check. You’ve lost thousands of loyal customers… Other period apps offer so much more for free now.",

When I gained access to them, I realized that the app is still really basic. The user interface on the analysis page is not good. I have to do the work myself to figure out where in my cycle the symptoms occurred. Clue claims to be about empowerment and science but doesn’t listen to its audience re pop ups or stay consistent against crisis pregnancy centers - just read the reviews. It’s a blatant cash grab and data grab, and it’s profiting off the very people it claims to support with a product that isn’t worth their money.",

The full screen popups are so bad, I have to navigate a minefield of subscription buttons just to track my flow for the day. I understand that subscriptions are important to support the app but the popup ads do not need to be actively destroying the functionality of the free version. A banner at the top of the screen would be fine. Because of the popups I am considering moving on to a new tracker instead which is extremely disappointing because I really enjoyed using clue before.",

And I absolutely HATE when you go to save something you want to track and the ad pops up after every single save. It is the most annoying thing ever!

Before you could select the drink type and amount on the same screen. Now you have to click through two screens. Also three drink types show in the box instead of one. I assume the one in the middle is the selected one? I dunno, but this update seems completely unnecessary and makes me dislike the app now when previously I loved it.",

It also allows you edit entries, even from previous days. \nIt has optional settings that allow you to customize many things.

        "內容": "I love this app a lot. However, they recently removed some free features including very importantly to whitelist three apps. It used to be one could whitelist up to three on the free version and more on the plus version. I think that’s very unfortunate. Sometimes there are critical apps, that I need to be able to use during a focus session.  I started using tide as a student. Even now I barely ever pay for apps, however if there was $1/month subscription ($12/year), I would do it. Or pay once and never again for all the premium features. Or if they had a donate button, pay for our coffee type of button, I would occasionally donate as I feel grateful for it’s existence (prior to removing whitelist options). If they keep removing free features and don’t bring this one back I’ll have to find/make another app. The pricing model is way too expensive for what the app is.\n\nThis app has frozen in IOS in focus mode. I had to restart my phone and then all my apps were still locked until I restarted and restored the tide session. Please remove these  bugs.",

        "內容": "I’ve been with TIDE for four years (with paid subscription) and it went from an amazingly simple sound app to a horrendously complicated bloated application. You can do breathing exercises, you can do meditation, you can sleep, you can do HRV, you can connect to the new Apple Watch (btw loved that little commercial that you all programmed in there - NOT!) you can do this, you can do that!!! At some point, I’m sure they’ll even get it to do my laundry!\nOh my gosh! I loved the simplicity and quickness of the app. But the changes over the past year have not only slowed the app (about 3 to 5 seconds to load each screen) but the latest update includes so many options that it’s ridiculous. If I wanted an insanely complicated app I would’ve signed up for Calm.\n\nEven with all this I put up with it, until now. I just needed some music to focus with and that process was just an absolute nightmare to accomplish. Not only do I have to wait 3 to 5 seconds for each topic in the sound section to load but it takes about 2-3 seconds to load the audio as it slowly fades in with a background. And now, if you realize that’s not the sound you want, and you decide to go back and choose another one, you have to confirm on a pop-up that Yes! I want to replace the currently playing audio with the new audio I just selected!!! Please stop with the Microsoft “are you sure you’re sure?” popup screens.  \n\nI opened the app so I could get some nice serene music to focus and calm me down because work/computer had me mad. Only it did the opposite and brought to a new level of anger I can only describe as livid! Absolutely completely livid! \nSomething that was supposed to be relaxing, simple, and useful is completely DREADFUL! \nI am done with this app! I’m done! I am canceling my subscription!",

I feel $7 at the most is reasonable, and even adding the option for a one time fee lifetime membership would be good.",

Considering what’s available for subscription. Our free option is severely lacking. Been with tide for years now the best sleeping app I trust to use because the quality is great. My only standing complaint is not enough free choices for sleeping tunes. Or the option to purchase some sounds were to still be there. Yes I was around when that option was available. Quality sound choices for free are just as important as the subscription choices. It’s been feeling stagnant for some time now and I hope to see this improve.",

It is my hope that this app will continue to evolve in a way that benefits users and fairly balances free (or single-payment features) with the monetization scheme that seems to be a drawback for some. This app has come a long way, and it has been a journey worth staying for. \n\nI would fully recommend this to anyone who is looking to build better habits or get better sleep.\n\nAnd once again, thank you to the developers for creating such a pleasant, life-enhancing app 🙏",

I have tried many other white noise apps in the past, and I have deleted all of them within a few days because of the very annoying pay walls that they have set up. This is not the case with Tide, which I have been using for at least 1.5 years now. However, in the past month or so, the app has been crashing midway through the night midway. This has caused the white noise to stop, which wakes me up. This has been a huge problem, and I am not sure why it is occurring. Maybe it is because I have an older iPhone (7)? Either way, I hope the Tide developers look into this crashing problem, but to all the readers of this review who are looking for a white noise app, you should definitely try out Tide, as it is one of the best out there if you don’t want to pay to play white noise while you sleep.",

The plant designs are adorable, the music is nice and relaxing, and there’s a lot of variety for plants and pots. However, the system for calculating the amount of water you need to drink seems a bit odd. I have a large water container that holds 24 oz of water. According the app, I need to finish all the water in my bottle 5 times everyday. That would be liked drinking 15 cups of water a day. I don’t think I could do that. Also, I really wish there was more variety for the free side of the app, but I guess they want to make money somehow, so subscription it is 🤷🏽‍♀️",

I thought about spending money on this app but I don’t want to pay a subscription nor do I want to spend any money after this annoying ad issue. When watching ads for pots they keep giving you the same pots you already got from watching ads. \nSimple enough to start using. I love the idea of their being a plant in responsible for and it’s helping. I know this one won’t die like my real life plants due to my lack of green thumb 😅. My young children love how cute this app is and wanted to download it too! Now they are drinking water on their own and they are excited about seeing the difference when they use the bathroom.

I find this app to be motivating and I decided to do Flora care because knowing my focus time will plant actual trees really does motivate me!! I care a lot about the environment so combining the two was a great idea!! \n\nI would suggest to add some pictures of the actual trees or plants that have been planted in the app from people using it or messages from people where the plants are growing. I think that would really be motivating! It would motivate the users even more to see and hear how people focusing is growing new plants and helping others.  I also hope I will be able to go on a tour in the app to the places where my trees will grow. I would love it if the App integrated some information about the plants and trees too because I love learning about botany. \n\nI really find this app to be a great example of social entrepreneurship 🌟",

I would exit out the app to go look at the email with the code and go back to the Flora App where I input the numbers. When I put the numbers in it said the numbers were wrong and that they expired. I go back and forth between my email and Flora but it kept saying the same thing. Every time I would exit out the app then come back it would resend a new code. So I’m locked out of my account because of this verification code mess. Couldn’t even see if the app was good as the reviews said it was. 😒🙄😤",

Great job Nike and the best part of it is that the whole app became absolutely free several years ago in the middle of COVID-thanks Nike!!",

It is pretty lame to keep asking the app user to do something while the problem is clearly on the app.",

        "內容": "I’ve been really enjoying my time in this game. The more I get invested into it, the more it is I am wanting go out and about. You can dedicate as much or little time as you want, and something I really appreciate is not having any FOMO mechanics that make we want to login when I don’t want to. \n  My only real complaint is how hard it is to accumulate coins. You really need to invest time and effort to even get a small amount. I know they are primarily used for cosmetics, but you are able to use them for storage increases for your Pikmin and items. That makes the process of acquiring coins that much more annoying as you have a reason to get coins even if you don’t care about the cosmetics. And another thing I don’t care about at all is how typically 1 coin equals 1 cent(yes I know there are bonuses,but for the sake of my argument), but when you look at how much it costs to do a storage upgrade, the amount of coins it takes to upgrade is way higher than the dollar amount when converted. For example, nectar storage costs $1.99, so you’d think it would take like 200 coins to upgrade. Instead, it takes 350 coins. That’s an extra $1.50 in coins. Which might not seem a lot, but when you are trying to play free to play with how hard it is to farm coins, it actually is quite big. \n  I know you need to make money. I get that. And I really do appreciate that you don’t do ads. But I think it’s unfair for people who don’t have the means or simply just don’t want to give money to be sort of punished because of it. I’d say either lessen the amount of coins it takes to upgrade, or increase how fast it takes to farm coins.",

As a long time fan of the Pikmin series, this is exactly the best way to make a mobile Pikmin game. This game has also gotten me through so many hard times in life. I have Chronic illnesses which often keep me bed bound. However, because of pikmin bloom, I have incentive to leave my bed, my room, and my house. I’ve made so many friends because of this game!",

I like how you don’t need to go to a specific place just to get a certain Pikmin type, although you do need to go to certain places to get their decor. Another thing I also like is that you don’t need to have the game open all the time to find fruits and seedlings, you just need to walk around they will eventually appear in the area. The only thing I don’t like is that (unless you’re willing to pay with your own money) the only way to earn coins in this game is by planting flowers, and it’s really slow, considering that the minimum amount of coins you need to buy anything is 100 coins. Other than that, it’s a great game and I really like to walk around with the Pikmin!",

On top of that, the app notifies you (based on your stats) of when it thinks you should go to the hospital. That way you don’t have to analyze the data yourself. I’m so so glad I had this for my birth. I will definitely be recommending it to other birthing parents.",

Was using my own timer on the side and when I came back to the app for the next contraction, it was just going to play the rest of the ad. This made it so I couldn’t log the next contraction so this app is unserious about helping.",

You can’t delete a contraction if you accidentally bump it so it is included of your frequency log even if it wasn’t correct. It also PLAYS NOISY ADDS THAT YOU CAN’T SKIP even if you need to end or start a contraction. It’s not just an read advertisement you can press the x. It’s got sounds and everything. I’m so glad I had the opportunity to trial it with a false labor incident so I don’t have to deal with it in real time. It would have completely thrown off my relaxation. Don’t use this app. There are numerous others that work great.",

I will continue using this app for as long as they keep it updated and relevant. \n\nRESOLVED: I really love this app, but tonight it gets 2 stars and that’s being generous. When I tried to enter my liquid intake today it wouldn’t go past the opening screen. I tried several times throughout the day. I finally deleted it and reinstalled it. Now I can’t get past the initial set up page. I will update this if the issue is resolved. RESOLVED",

Also I wish the app was more interactive in the partner version. All they can do is answer quiz questions and that gets lame because they are usually the same questions over and over.",

At first everything seemed great but then once I finally got past the survey, I couldn’t use anything! Everything requires you to get a premium subscription which is ridiculous. It seems stupid that I have to spend money and have a subscription just to have a basic understanding of my body. The advertisement was very misleading and I’m just disappointed because I was excited to see an app that would actually educate me about my body only to learn I have spend money for that😕",

        "內容": "I used Flo regularly about 10 years ago and enjoyed it. I downloaded it again a few months ago and have experienced only frustration and annoyance. The ads encouraging you to upgrade to premium are obtrusive, relentless, and interfere with the functionality of the app. Any time you open the app or try to do anything you are bombarded with 2-4 ad screens that you are forced to cycle through. The free version of the app isn’t even worth it because it’s actually kind of hard to see patterns, which is the whole point of a tracking app. For example, on the main screen it doesn’t even tell you what day of your cycle you are in- you have to click into the calendar for that. I can’t speak to the paid version since I haven’t tried it. But as far as I can tell the paid app is designed for people who don’t know how to Google things.",

Nine YEARS of logging daily symptoms and cycles FOR NOTHING?? \nAnd to think this year I finally decided to get the premium subscription because I’ve loved being able to safely store all of my women related issues and symptoms. \nHow is it I have a premium subscription that expires in November 2025 yet I have no account? \n\nI’m so furious.

In Florida. when I was staying at a hotel in Florida Jacksonville to be specific, they gave me three nights at one price and then the rest of the month at another price actually $40 more expensive. They did not tell me that no email no price disclosure upfront that $40 difference wasn’t just oh a few dollars here but by the time you add 40% in the taxes down here, it’s more than $1000. Trivago does nothing and the people around the world have no clue oh will give you $50 in credit. I plan on making my marketing skills very beautifully used enjoy trivago. Enjoy trivago.",

        "內容": "I recently went through Trivago to book a hotel in Tampa. It led me to a booking site called Algotels. I paid for the room, but never got a confirmation number, so on the day before I was supposed to leave I called them to cancel. They said they would refund me and I ended up booking through the hotel website. They confirmed my room and gave me a confirmation number. Then I got an email mail from Algotel not only refusing to refund me, but they gave me the same email confirmation number I booked MYSELF through the hotel. I complained to Trivago and they said they couldn’t do anything because it was a 3rd party site. BEWARE! Trivago does not hold these 3rd party sites responsible, nor does it seem like they vette any of these sites for legitimacy. You are out on a limb, once you make an interaction. I may not get my money back, but at least I may help someone else from making the same mistake.\n\nUPDATE: Trivago vettes ADVERTISERS, not booking agencies. My mistake. What are people downloading Trivago for? Advertisements? Folks there you have it, straight from the source itself. Again, learn from my mistake and save your money.",

I could see days and weeks I could not or did not walk. Walking in nature became joy. In time it did not matter how many steps I took. As long as I took the steps. I went from 1200 to 3000. Soon I will take 15k steps in the morning. Thank you Pacer.",

This is a great way to get in shape, but unfortunately the subscriptions are all too expensive, and all the rewards you receive are only discounts for the subscription, and it doesn’t really make the price any more affordable. I am almost 16, so from my perspective this makes it a lot harder for younger users. The overall experience is great though, and I would definitely recommend this.",

Once I started using this app I found that all I had to do was remind myself to complete specific workouts each day, stay on pace with the videos, and I would be fine. \n\nThe app lets you go at your own pace which is great compared to working out in a group where you have to keep up with everyone else. Eventually you can increase the intensity as you see fit. The hardest part of doing the workout is finding the motivation to start it, but this app uses a similar system to Duolingo which is great at keeping you hooked. Great app overall! There’s plenty you can get done with just the free version.",

For some reason they think gyms don’t have pull-up bars. This is a huge oversight. It’s one of the best and most popular exercises around but you can’t log them on this app. They have plenty of exercises that require a bench and/or weights. But for some reason pull-ups is a no-go. Overall, this is a good app with lots of exercises to choose from. I’ll happily give 5 stars when the app navigation is more intuitive. Please add pull-ups to the mix.",

Most of the reviews in China are fake, businesses pay for fake reviews from different groups. They often put a pretty girl on the cover to get clicks. A spa that I recently charged a 1000 membership shut down over night, the business owner ran away, leaving all members holding the bag. No explanation. Phone number down - no customer service. “Welcome to China”. I tried to write a half a star rating and was rejected by DianPings corrupt system for “violation of usage rules” whatever the f that means. This app is as corrupt as its business registrants. So use due diligence when using anything Chinese. When everyone has 5 stars, you need to use some common sense on what’s actually good or bad. This app is a disgrace!",

I can run both Nike Run Club and Strava on my phone at the same time, and Strava will consistently overstate the stats. It’s the same if I run with someone else and compare stats. It also overstates when comparing to my Apple Watch or Garmin. Bottom line - why would you pay for premium if the app can’t give you accurate stats.",

So I asked the chatbot if there’s another way to add activity manually and it responded saying to use the plus sign to add manual activity. Which again, there is no plus sign. Also have no idea how else to reach out to Strava so came here. Fix your app and updated your website with the updates you put onto the app.",

I was in the search of a heart rate app and stumbled upon this one hoping it could track my heart rate when needed and help with my POT syndrome. Sadly i was wrong. This app counts my heart rate way off most of the time. My heart rate will be at anything from 110-180 standing but it tells me around 60 bpm! This app tends to work when my heart rate is 50-70 anything above that it gets completely wrong…Also out of curiosity i put the heart rate app monitor on a chair to see what it said. It said THE CHAIR HAD A HEARTBEAT of 80BPM. Now its got me wondering if the heart rates are just completely random. Hoping the creators of this app can figure out a solution. Amazing idea but its just not working out and im sure im not the only one having problems like this. Hope you take my review into consideration \n\nIf your reading i would not recommend getting this app\n\n Thanks",

    "應用描述": "StressWatch 已被全球 171 個國家/地區蘋果應用商店推薦——\n◎ 八月最佳 APP\n◎ The Best Apps for iOS 18\n◎ 首頁主打推薦\n◎ Apple Watch 必備\n◎ 新 APP 推薦\n◎ 本周編輯推薦\n\nStressWatch透過分析蘋果手錶HRV心率變異性和靜息心率等數據，幫助你理解當前身體疲勞和心理壓力程度，及時提醒壓力狀態，幫助你更好地感知、管理與應對壓力。StressWatch透過讀取蘋果手錶存儲到蘋果健康內的心率數據來檢測你的HRV（Heart Rate Variability，心率變異性）和靜息心率，及時提醒你的壓力狀態，通過統計分析給出相關洞察，讓身心更平靜輕鬆。生活慢一點也可以溫柔閃亮！\n\nStressWatch可以怎樣幫到你\n\n當我們在深夜加班的時候，StressWatch可以在手錶上提醒我HRV偏低注意壓力——我意識到我今天不需要再卷了，工作留到明天做吧；\n當社恐的我們混在派對裡強顏歡笑的時候，提醒我HRV偏低注意壓力——我意識到我不需要迎合他人，於是換個讓自己更開心的社交方式；\n當我們在喝悶酒時候，提醒我HRV過低壓力過載，我意識到喝酒並不是排解壓力的好辦法，於是會少喝一些更愛惜自己身體；\n把HRV讀數放在手錶表盤上，一抬腕就知道最近的壓力狀況，決定接下來是要卷還是躺；\n堅持良好作息、運動一段時間後，通過每周、每月的統計告訴我這段時間的壓力值比上個月明顯有所下降，整個人狀態都好了很多。\n為什麼做這個產品\n這是一個內卷又焦慮的時代，AI每天都在爆炸性的發展，彷彿要取代我們所有人的工作。每家公司都在996，每個人都活在一不努力就可能被時代抛棄的巨大壓力中。曾經我們也是公司裡的卷王，經常為了公司項目從早上八點一直卷到晚上十二點，跨時區會議多數還拖堂到凌晨。週末彷彿變成了一個遙遠的概念，為了產品能按時上線，放棄週末去加班變成了基本操作。卷得太劇烈，壓力過大，身體都默默承受了，後移的髮際線是身體的求救信號。於是我們開始思考，有沒有更及時的方式能讓我們了解身體的壓力水平。偶然機會了解到HRV這個概念，借助它可以很好地量化我們自身的壓力。\n\n設計理念\n做StressWatch這個App的初衷是想幫助大家在這個焦慮的時代減少壓力慢下來。StressWatch的科學依據是基於HRV（心率變異性）數值的靜息心率的壓力測量，但僅僅告訴用戶冰冷數字容易營造出悲壯的「壓力過載」氛圍（我們不希望大家比慘），生活中也已經有太多的數字了，OKR、KPI、NPS。我們一直在思考，如何給理性的數據注入一些溫度？應該用什麼樣的情感化表達，幫助大家更好的和產品連接以產生共情。\n於是，就有了「壓力泡泡」這個產品形象，「泡泡」就是我們克服壓力緩解焦慮的夥伴，他會隨著你的壓力狀態變化改變自己的顏色，但是無論壓力如何都能泰然處之。我們沒法控制外在的環境，就像我們沒法控制天氣一樣。但無論外面是晴天、雨天、甚至暴風雨，當不同壓力狀態的你每次打開app，都能看到一個神情自如、可愛輕鬆的泡泡。TA提醒你慢一些，在你最慌亂的時候給你的心一個柔軟的擁抱。\n\n未來產品功能規劃\n\n- 更豐富的手錶表盤掛件\n- 手機桌面小組件\n- 快速HRV測量\n- HRV和靜息心率趨勢\n- 每日恢復狀態評估\n- 歡迎聯繫我們\n\n你可以通過以下方式找到我們\n電子郵箱: badideas100@hotmail.com\n小紅書 @StressWatch App\n\n非常期待聽到你的建議，你的支持和建議是我們不斷迭代的動力來源！\n蘋果健康整合\nStressWatch通過蘋果健康讀取來自蘋果手錶的心率健康數據。StressWatch需要獲取蘋果健康的讀取授權，以提醒、統計壓力時刻、提供建議，否則無法正常使用。請放心，你的健康數據僅儲存在本地，我們不上傳任何你的健康數據。\n\n訂閱價格和條款\nStressWatch可以免費下載，若選擇升級到StressWatch Pro版本，則可以解鎖所有付費功能。\n我們提供一次性購買、按月和按年自動續訂三種不同的購買選項。\n\n按月或按年訂閱的說明：確認並支付後，將通過你的蘋果iTunes帳號自動續訂。扣費成功後，順延一個訂閱周期。若需退訂，請在當前訂閱期結束前至少24小時內，手動在iTunes / Apple ID設置管理中關閉自動續費功能。試用期內，如不取消訂閱，則會在試用期結束時自動開通訂閱並扣款。本服務由您自助選擇是否取消，若您選擇不取消，將為您開通下一個計費周期的續費服務。\n\n健康建議的免責聲明\nStressWatch提供的所有信息和建議不可以被視作醫療建議或診斷，請勿替代專業的診斷和治療。如果感覺壓力過大無法調節，以及做出任何醫療決定之前，請及時尋求專業醫生幫助。\n\n用戶協議和隱私條款\n用戶協議 https://100badideas.notion.site/Terms-of-Use-5518359e0a234729ae94bdb94d983183\n隱私條款 https://100badideas.notion.site/Privacy-Policy-79e458f14518433aa0c0322d678daa1a",

        "內容": "I love this app and am a paying member for the time being. This has been helpful in training me to tune into my body and recognize what stress feels like. I’ve even started to notice high stress levels on my own a few times now which is a really big deal for me. \n\nI’m giving 3 stars because the data analysis is just not where it needs to be in my opinion. In the paid version you can see historical data back as far as it goes and you have the option to log how you are feeling mentally and physically at the time of a stress notification. You can also associate that notification with things like work, fitness, and alcohol and you can add your own custom ones as well. While logging these things has been helpful for personal reflection and recognition on my own, there is zero analysis of this data in the app. Here are examples of what would be useful:\n-Your HRV is lower and more controlled on days you have not logged alcohol.\n-Your reported feeling focused or energized more on days you have logged fitness.\n- On average you log feeling tense and overwhelmed between 2-5 pm on weekdays 40% of the time. \n- or 60% of your highest stress levels last month were logged between 2-5pm on weekdays. \n\nI want it to recognize patterns in the data so that I can make changes to my life that prevent stress BEFORE it happens, not just while it is happening. \nFor now, I’m going to keep using the app to continue building my skills in recognizing my own body sensations. But after another month or so I will likely cancel my subscription because $13 a month or $40 per year is too expensive just to be able to log how you are feeling and view historical data that has no helpful analysis or pattern recognition.",

I’m aware these things have a physical impact on my body, but if I can’t eat a normal meal at a restaurant without 3 hours of being panicked by “overload” readings, there’s an issue. Plus my Apple Watch essentially allows me access to similar data.

        "內容": "At first I believed whatever it showed but later on tried testing it out with my therapist. It kept telling me I was “overload” and high stress when I felt great, but kept wondering what if I was stressed and didn’t know it. Then when I was going through one of the worst most stressful moments the app notified me right then on my watch that my stress level was “great,” that’s when I realized the app was a gimmick and didn’t actually work! Don’t waste your time believing this can track your stress! In fact it’s way more stressful to get the notification that you “are stressed” then being stressed without it. Do yourself a favor and free yourself of this wasteful product, go outside, take a deep breath and go for a walk!",

You must better understand that simple statistics and graphics will not present a true picture of one’s state. Maybe some day.",

        "內容": "I initially downloaded this app to help manage my severe anxiety attacks after being hospitalized a few months ago. I was hoping it would provide insights into my episodes since I hadn’t experienced much anxiety before my hospitalization. Despite the high ratings, my experience was disappointing. I used the free version for some time but kept running into glitches, so I was desperate enough to try the free trial. Unfortunately, it was to no avail. The data was hours behind, alerts didn’t come in real time, and it glitched frequently with my watch. After the trial was over, it glitched even more. I tried to fix and repair it, but nothing worked, and deleted the app from my watch and phone. \n\nI requested a refund after a day of trying, but it was unsuccessful. The most frustrating part was the lack of customer support. Despite reaching out multiple times, I received no assistance or satisfactory explanations for the issues I encountered. This was an expensive mistake, and I hope my review helps others avoid a similar error in judgment.\nI never write reviews, but I felt compelled to warn others before purchasing this product. While it wasn’t the most expensive app, having something that doesn’t work as it should shouldn’t be the customer’s burden. Despite the high star rating, consider this app a fraud, even more so after my experience. As a few other people like me have had the same issue, I hope this review helps others avoid a similar mistake.",

And you’re also able to put a widget on Home Screen. And also able to put a widget on your Lock Screen. And it changes as much as you put it to. And I also have this app on my Apple Watch so you can also do that too. I totally would recommend if you like good inspiring quotes or any quotes this is really good in my opinion. Just wish there was more options for people the don’t pay. That’s my only negativity on this app. Other than that it’s all pros.",

Being retired, I didn’t realize I wrote in on the weekend which caused a delay in getting an answer. I waited a few days after fixing the problem. However when I factory reset my old phone, the App glitched again. Reset everything one more time and it has worked just fine since then. I’m back to living g the app again. No more counting my steps backwards. \n\nAlthough I’ve used this app for years and been satisfied with it, upgrading to an IPhone 16 has caused huge glitches in how it works. Out of the last 12 days since I upgraded, I’ve walked over 10,000 at least 7 of those days. I have watched the app count backward and reduce my numbers by 3000-5,0000 steps. Sometimes it happens the same day. Other times, it waits 1-2 days to reduce my numbers. Very unhappy with this app right now. I know you can do better because the app worked great for years.",

So all of the steps that I would wind up taking like in Home Depot and Walmart weren’t tracked in order to get my proper step count I would have to walk my necessary steps with the app open. This app tracks like they used to and the way they should. It tracks my steps and gives me a runing total for the day. So if I’ve walked 2 miles already today through various activities and I come out at night, I only have to walk a certain amount of miles to get to five. Thanks for a great app.",

I like this one because the GPS tracking is pretty accurate and is MUCH more accurate than Apple Watch’s app, Workout, which lets you believe you’re a much better runner than you really are since tracking starts to go off after you hit the half mile run. I compared about 5 Apple watch compatible GPS running apps and this was the only one that was reliable from an accuracy perspective and is user friendly. It has other advantages such as not having that awful auto pause that other apps don’t let you turn off. I like that I have to turn it on if I want it. The only small con is that the Stop button sticks and I have to hit it about 5 times for it to work each time I finish a run.",

It quite difficult to for example find my best 5k time for the year and compare it to my current training program. This addition will move my rating from a 3/5 to a 5/5. All the data is there, I would just like to use it in the app rather than copy it into a spreadsheet to crunch the split comparisons from week to week. I’m sure all serious athletes are also looking for a “split comparison over time” table. Thanks in advance for the consideration.",

        "內容": "Been using this app for months as it was a very good basic run tracker. I wanted to try out the subscription as I prepare for a 10K, and was extremely disappointed. \n\nThe paid features are a joke. \n- Setting your run to “interval training” doesn’t actually do anything. \n- There is little customization for audio feedback/reminders, and it won’t even tell you your split pace for each interval. It only gives you your average pace for the run as you go about your intervals.\n- It won’t automatically stop tracking after each interval, even though there is a setting for that. Doesn’t work.\n- In the analysis section I ALWAYS have 1 or 2 “spikes” where it says I was running a 4 minute mile. Completely ruins my data, not sure why these outliers arent flagged and deleted.\n\nReally disappointing, seems like really basic stuff that could be added quite easily. I will be unsubscribing and looking for a more serious app for my training.",

        "內容": "I had previously used a similar app that now no longer is free to use the features I wanted. This app and company are wonderful for the simple fact that you get premium if you buy their product. I needed a new bbt anyway so I bought theirs. It’s a little bit of a pain to connect the device every time but the one they have that has the temp on the device also would resolve that. Or if the thermometer in the future updates could store a days reading until connected. I was successful using the app to get pregnant, and many others are too. Community is there, though improvements could be made. Moderators or having at least one specialist or doctor who randomly responds to inquiries would be cool. Or if it was a paid extra to talk to a specialist, either way. As it is though, great useful app and would 10/10 recommend. I’ll use this app again if I should need to in the future. All my girlies will be using this as well when they’re ready. Thanks Femometer!",

I ordered the Femometer ring, which within a few weeks started having issues and was not accurately taking my temp. They exchanged the ring for me, which I’m super grateful for. The second ring accurately took my temperature, but then the app was not successfully syncing AND saving my data. I realized no data saved when I went to look at my monthly chart a few weeks later and it was empty (big bummer). I ordered their Bluetooth thermometer, hoping it might work better, but ran into the same issues. It stopped working and died after 3 weeks of use. I would not recommend Femometer, as there are too many technical issues, and I couldn’t track my temperatures and cycle effectively.",

Some may appreciate and want the community features but others like me find the anxieties and concerns and stories of miscarriage and such that abound on these pages overwhelming and stressful to the TTC process.

However, my main gripe is the difference between the paid and free subscription; namely the use of scanning or not. \n\nThere is no difference in the foods you have access to in the MFP database, the only difference is whether or not you can scan it when you’re trying to find it and that’s incredibly annoying. I don’t want to use it for macros, other diets, intermittent, etc, but I fully believe that access to a dietary plan should obviously be an additional charge. The fact that I can’t scan unless I pay $80/year - but can still manually type every food - just seems like you’re charging for convenience rather than any actual program. \n\nThat’s it though. It’s a great tool regardless, but even if you added a like….$15/yr charge option to scan that would be nice.",

Almost all apps saying in app purchases is going to make you pay for a subscription. If you want free workouts search the internet. It’s cheaper than a gym membership so what are you all complaining about. From what I can tell they have put a lot of thought into premium version. I like that I just click on the day and it tells me what workouts to do. I don’t have to think about anything. I also like that after you complete a workout, you can rate if a workout was too hard, too easy, or just right. I’m hoping that means they update your personal training plan based on your rating of the workout.  It’s also great that you can choose no equipment option so you don’t have buy a bunch of equipment or join a gym. Just try it, you might realize it’s worth it. Only complaint would be I can’t find away to adjust original settings of my goals.",

Totally doable. 5 minutes? Sure, why not. I stretch every morning with one of the routines. As a beginner some of the suggested routines kicked my butt, or are just way to hard. Yup, no muscle there! So I just try to modify it so I am at least trying. I’m not sure if the program actually customizes to each persons level. The water reminders throughout the day help too. I’ve never been so hydrated!!! \nI’m glad I took the leap, thanks!",

It’s just an awful way to spend money and time. It’s just overall underwhelming. Also no way to get your money back. I didn’t get a free trial offer so I just payed for the year after seeing some good reviews but I made a mistake with that and now I can’t contact anyone to get a refund. Do yourself a favor and just get the NTC app it’s so much better and it’s free.",

I don’t have money on my card cause of this charge that comes through 10 times a day Ana I’m not paying for something that I didn’t even sign up for this app is so stupid. So I advise you all so not get the free trial cause they will charge you for a year afterwards if you cancel the trial before it ends.

I typically wake up 1-4 hours before she does and when she wakes up she has great difficulty falling back to sleep. I snore and I thought this app could help me begin tracking the problems I’m having to help reduce the snoring and enhance my sleep quality. I worked the app into my sleep routine effortlessly. I always have a silent alarm on my watch that only I can feel to allow me to wake up soundlessly. But to my shock at 5AM my phone starts blaring music through this app. I had my phone on silent and the volume all the way down. No warning from the app end that there would be an audible alarm playing at the wake up time. An alarm I didn’t ask for because I already have one. A SILENT one. Doubtless this app works great when all the data is collected and you use it properly. But absolutely not for those wishing to keep peace at the wee hours of the morn.",

It’s never there, it’s always blank unless I click on the complication itself. It’s a nuisance. I’ve restarted the watch like they’ve said but it still doesn’t show unless I click on it. I hope they work on that.",

        "內容": "Once upon a time, there was a fitness app that seemed almost too good to be true. Imagine the ideal workout companion: a powerful tool that was fully customizable, beginner-friendly, and so simple that even the least tech-savvy could navigate it with ease. It was the app for everyone, designed with care and attention, and it built a reputation to match. In the days of free access, users everywhere celebrated its 4.9-star rating as more than deserved.\n\nYes, there were ads—but they were only brief interruptions after a workout, a small price to pay for something so extraordinary and free. And in return, we had everything we could ever want: effective workouts, guidance for every level, a seamless experience, and no strings attached. It felt like the developers had put users first, as though they truly cared about our journey to better health.\n\nThen, seemingly overnight, everything changed. The developers took this beloved app and slapped a price tag on it, demanding subscriptions for the same features that were once free. No added perks, no extra benefits—just the same app at a monthly cost, as if our loyalty and positive reviews suddenly meant nothing. The joy of using it has faded, leaving only the bitterness of feeling exploited.\n\nIt’s heartbreaking to see something so perfect turn into just another cash grab. What was once a remarkable tool is now a reminder that, in the end, we were only customers.",

For example: what use is doing leg raises for 50 seconds helpful if you struggle to do eight of them? Or maybe you struggle with T planks, you go form having to do 3 or 4 reps each side to 16+ seconds? I can understand the desire to enforce strict form, and maybe that’s what they were attempting with the timer? But its poorly implemented and poorly thought out. This was one of my go to apps, and now it’s just another trash bin app to be deleted and forgotten about. Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who’s actually trying to improve their fitness, wouldn’t recommend it to anyone trying to maintain their fitness, and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who just wants to download an app to look like they’re working out. Would rate lower if possible, the last update neutered it 0/10.",

The images supplied are adorable! You, Dad, and anyone else you choose can make journal entries and add photos/screenshots/emojis. You can also track mom’s health and symptoms optionally. The final product is an adorable diary of your pregnancy conception to birth. Do not be discouraged at check out that the dollar amount is listed in Japanese currency, this book is not expensive - just look up a currency calculator to figure out your total. Also, there are options for regular or deluxe. I just can’t say enough about how much we love our book. My only regret is I didn’t know about this with my other children! It’s adorable!",

I haven’t found any other app that enables you to make a book based on your pregnancy rather than following the baby’s life. These are things I would love to share with my future child in addition to their milestones and photos outside of the womb.\n\nI think it’d be cool if it utilized a bit of Qeepsake’s features, where we get guided questions pertinent  to our pregnancy texted and emailed to us.",

And notifications are nice as well since you can fine tune what comes through to the watch. \n\nThe calendar function is terrible; it doesn’t allow you to select certain calendars, and you can’t disable notifications if you allow the app access to your device calendars. The weather app/complication is also not so great because it doesn’t update very fast, and it shows the sun out at all times of day and night (why not show the moon and stars during the night?).",

So he never gets that rewarding feeling of “marking off” a honey-do task that I put in there and it depletes his motivation for using the app.\n\nPlease add shared journal editing.

It syncs via iCloud if you have multiple devices. Total worth the investment if you want to go Premium. Support takes a few days to get back to you (better than weeks!) and they update this app so often (almost weekly) you’re guaranteed bug fixes; so if support takes awhile to get back to you, rest assured an almost weekly update will fix it the next time.

No longer can I add multiple photos to an entry. No longer are all of my photos accessible to add to entries. And no longer can I synch with my MacBook. I’m done paying for more and more monthly subscriptions. If Apple Journal would import my entries, I’d gladly pay just to get away from an app that changed the rules. Bye bye Day One!\n\nUpdate:\nReceived a reply from developer explaining pricing. However, no explanation as to why features I originally paid for are no longer available unless I upgrade.\nUpdate 1/7/25:\nI reached out to developer as recommended. I received a reply stating that the version I purchased  is no longer supported. So now I understand. The developer was allowed to change the name of the app and no longer support that version and no longer will provide the same features as I had originally purchased unless I pay $35/year. You would think original users would be grandfathered into the new version since the original users are those who helped with their success.",

Start a chat ability or release give an email right upfront. You have a choice spend 20 minutes of your life and chase your tail or go ahead and email.

        "內容": "December 2024 Update: They changed the UI, for the worse, AGAIN. It is tremendously buggy - something not seen in years with the old owners. Automatic is ruining this app - what a shame. This WAS an app of the year for many years - it is no longer. I have fully moved to Apple Notes and Apple Journal. I loved DayOne, and wanted to stay, but Automatic is running it into the ground and seems to have no idea, or no desire, to actually maintain the app properly. This changed my perspective on Automatic too. Kind of shocked at how quick the downfall was for DayOne. I wonder what the original owners think. May 2024 UPDATE: They decided to totally change the UI. Yet again. It looks nothing like the award winning app of old, and they’re removing functionality (like you can’t see your sync status on the home screen anymore - arguably one of the most important functions of the app). The decline continues. I’m preparing to go to another journal service soon. I had high hopes but it’s clear Automatic is drastically changing things. This isn’t the Day One we all knew and loved. ANOTHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal.",

I'd rather be able to only track the actual calories burned - especially because the in-app, on-screen estimates are way too generous.\n\nHowever, it's a good app with a large variety of workouts and plans. The beginner workouts do get my heart rate up, which is what I need for my health.",

I brush with 100% coverage it even tells me that before the end screen but then when it gives me a final score it keeps giving me a zero saying I have poor coverage, which isn’t true! Please fix app update… this is so frustrating. My brush is only 2 months old and my brush is connected and synched, brush head cleaned and attached properly. I went through all trouble shooting steps, and it’s not me, it’s the app. Please don’t respond and tell me to contact you guys to talk more about the issues, this IS me contacting you about the issues and asking you guys to please update the app to fix these bugs. Whoever is reading/monitoring these take note, and pass all these complaints about the app on to whoever is in charge and let them know the app desperately needs to be fixed/updated. That is your job (as the person who monitors these reviews) to assure the consumers end up happy with the product, and is the point of us leaving reviews. Thank you. 🪥🦷",

That makes me brush longer, which may be detrimental to my gums.  Maybe it’s because I have to tilt my head back because the iO brush heads have holes in them which prevent making a good seal with your lips.  This forces the user to let toothpaste-spit drool all over the place.  There ought to be a better design for this that still allows the head to be rinsed clean after use.

I love that it has a recently used foods item and does a comprehensive macro and calorie calculator for you that doesn’t require premium cost. I’ve been extremely happy with this app since I’ve been using it. Also, it has such an extensive database of name, brand, and restaurant based foods that you can pull into your daily calorie counting and the scan feature is by far the best I’ve seen.",

Like the camera is still using the back camera, but maybe it is in mirror mode, so when you move the ipad, the camera moves the opposite way that you’d expect it to. Still the best app for tracking!\n\nUpdate 12/4/24.    FatSecret is still my #1 go to app for when I need to get back on track with my dietary habits.  I tried out several other apps recently, but nothing else is as efficient or works as well with my Fitbit (including the Fitbit app itself).   There still a glitch with scanning a barcode when using ipad in landscape mode.  I use a keyboard case which makes inputting food a breeze, but when i pop open the barcode scanner option, the camera rotates the picture 90 degrees.",

In my 20’s, I was successful in losing 30+ lbs. by counting calories, reducing my portions, exercising more, and drinking more water. I have kept it off for the longest time. I’m now in my 70’s and I get back to watching my calories if I gain more than three pounds. I’ve only got a few pounds to lose currently but it’s still very useful. I even add my cheat calories - can’t feel totally deprived! It’s also necessary at times when my husband wants to go out or we are meeting friends out. I especially like the pie chart that displays the carbs, fat, and protein. The app also tracks your fiber intake which helps to remind me to include more fiber in my diet plans. The app includes a wide variety of name brands for tracking your food intake. It includes many grocery store brands and restaurants/fast-food chains. In the past I have used the exercise and sleep tracker, but I haven’t used the water tracker feature, although I’m a huge proponent for drinking water! I recommend this free app for your weight loss journey! Good luck!",

I was deeply disappointed to receive an email stating that Adidas is shutting down the application in this region and will also delete my account and all associated data.\n\nI have been using this app for years, and it’s frustrating to think that all my hard-earned progress and valuable data will simply vanish. I’ve always been satisfied with the app and its well-designed plans, but this abrupt decision has left me disheartened.\n\nNow I understand why so many people prefer Strava—it offers continuity and reliability, something I thought Adidas Running provided until now.\n\nSincerely,\nStella",

For example, it does not allow integers to be used in the member bio section. It simply deletes any number used. I opened a support ticket a few months ago and I was given the standard recommended fix of updating my phone, the app, and reinstalling the app - all of which I had already done on my own, to no avail. I t reported this back to support, and that was the last contact. And the issue persists. \n\nSecondly, the rules for earning points state 3 points per mile ran/walked. I have consistently only earned 2 points per mile. I opened a ticket on this a month ago, and nothing has been corrected yet. \n\nFinally, when I started to use the app 5 years ago, I thought it was pretty cool to be able to add my footwear, choosing from a list of most manufacturers. Now, however, they don’t even keep the list of Adidas shoes current which begs the question: why even provide a model list if it’s outdated?",

Stories that I have run to for years. I can’t find my history like I use to in Runtastic. I have lost every run and my favorite story running tracks. Listen, I am so disappointed that I lost my history and my tracks that I don’t think I could ever participate in adidas products. It left a bad taste in my mouth. They bought out Runtastic for absolutely nothing. To shut rhem down, take its customers, and lose them all.",

Three weeks in to this new plan, the treadmill option to follow my running plan is no longer available and will only allow me to do the running plan if I’m using GPS features. Given I live in an area where there is fluctuating heat and weather patterns, running outside is only possible half or less of the time. I’m a little disappointed and will be changing to a different app/paid service so that I can follow a running plan that allows me more flexibility.",

I run every day and I use it to zoom in and review where I’ve been, pace, mileage breaks, elevation, temperature, etc. now it’s suddenly gone. What happened??

I didn’t really know what I was doing and would run too hard too soon with no breaks. I would just hurt and thought I sucked at running. I viewed it as a necessary evil that I needed to overcome. I also thought that I should be a lot better at running than I was and I hated it. I made one of my New Year’s resolutions a few years ago to “run more and get better at it” #newyearnewme, I know.\n\nA friend of mine recommended downloading the NRC app so we could keep each other accountable. I tried a few guided runs with coach Bennett and it felt like he legit was in my brain dispelling all the negative self talk I usually did  on my runs in the past “I’m not fast enough, I’m not fit enough, I’m not a runner” I realized I’m not alone in feeling like this. I started to “own my fitness” and ran appropriately. I rested more. I had a better mindset and positively talked to myself. Running became easier (not easy)! I stopped dreading the runs and now look forward to it. I don’t usually write reviews, but I really am so grateful. Thank you all, and best of luck running!",

Plenty of training programs with guided runs and great place to track your progress all in one place. \n\nOne thing I think could be helpful and I know Nike really wants to keep this approachable and pure, but some education on running form/style could be helpful. I got some runners knee about a month into training, was running on some basic gym shoes for a while. I ended upgraded to some Pegasus shoes and realized, as a heel runner, that was exactly exactly what I needed too. The swoosh is still cool, nice to see Nike “hitting their stride” again, I think they got a little too distracted for a while.",

Running in a group motivates you much more to stay consistent, so if Nike can incorporate a section to find runners in your area and being able to chat with a few.

Once a week I use four running apps and my G-Shock to track my distance and run time to determine which apps are in sync, and this app consistently shows a much farther distance and faster pace. On average, a 5 mile run will show the same on everything else, but this app will show that I ran between 6.8 or 7.1 miles, making my pace 4 minutes faster than reality. I have tried deleting the app and redownloading it and that has not fixed the issue. I regularly run in the mountains of Jordan, the desert of Iraq, the inner city of Phoenix, and other locations I frequent, and despite the altitude or LOS to any satellites, the Nike Run App never fails to disappoint me. I almost failed a fitness test for employment because I was using the Nike Run App and running at the pace it showed. The morning of the fitness test, I used multiple apps and almost had a panic attack when my 6:45 pace from Nike was actually 9:35 pace with the other apps. I hope this app gets delisted from the App Store.",

        "內容": "This is probably the best pomodoro app for Apple watch users. In particular because you can see the time left at a glance.  The main issue is that there seems to be some disconnect between the widget, the pop up, and the app. Concretely, I get many phantom notifications on my watch even when a pomodoro is not supposed to be running. This seems to occur when I skip a break when the pop up comes. Or make some changes by using the Last session widget directly on the watch clock face and not the app. It would be very nice if this could be fixed!",

Everything about the UI is intuitive, pleasant, and easy to use .It’s an undeniable factor at play in my success in post-graduate education and I have recommended this app to all my peers.\n\nSomething I’d love to see added:\n- A setting that allows the timer to continue running once the focus session is done — also contributing to the tomato size. \n(For reference, I think Forest has this feature where the timer continues past the set time if allowed and the size of your tree increases accordingly)\n\nAt times I’d like to focus beyond the set time, and I tend to lose track of exactly how much time I continued to focus past said time. This can skew the tracking (something I greatly value in this app, and a great for of accountability for myself and my peers), as adding it manually from memory can be inaccurate.",

Only thing is, I remember seeing someone ask for a ‘shop’ where we could use our tomatoes for different features in the app. I totally agree, and i wanted to add a few ideas. \n\nMaybe, once enough are collected, we can customize the look of the app. Maybe use some kind of wallpaper. Or, customize the tomatoes themselves! Completed pomodoros could earn greater rewards, while incomplete ones could yield smaller ones. Maybe add some kind of streak bonus, or a bonus when a full pomodoro cycle is completed? Maybe even add different sfx instead of just rain sounds to the app! Like, white or dark noise?",

        "內容": "I’ve played this game since it came out for about ten years. It tracks your steps and you can create really cute planets. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars over the years on asteroids/subscribing. My biggest issue is that when you get a new phone you lose your progress. You log into their “sparkful” account and they tell you your progress is saved . Currently I have an iPhone 16 when I logged in I lost years of progress from the last new phone, iPhone 13 … That means I lost progress from 2021 when the 13 came out!!!! That’s maddening!!! I’ve played this game every day logging in a few times a day, it’s the only game Ive played consistently even on my lunch breaks. After losing so much progress and having to start again I feel disappointed and I will not keep playing this. Why can’t your game be saved in the cloud? And yes I contacted support I got a response to delete the app and log in again. That was worse! I was up to 30 days to wait to build a new planet my food capacity was at 99,000 this game has me at 30,000. Each time I did a super harvest I got 1 million, now it’s at 20,000. Who wants to rebuild planets I already had for years now!?!?\nUPDATE:\nLemme say after going back and forth in emails the developers )for a week )they found my account and helped me log back in so remember your log in. I’m back and I didn’t change this review because I want you to know that they helped me fix it and I have my account back … thank you Lily 😉",

Something that I didn't like about this app was the ads. It was bearable but annoying, also given the option to pay $23.99 USD for a premium subscription. This app was easy and straightforward to use even better with the instructors showing proper technique with very self explanatory instructions. I would recommend this app for people who want a quick exercises, or different instructed videos for working out.",

I recommend other users to download this. Feel free to download flo but this app here clover tracks your cycle more on point rather than flo! I really appreciate you for making this app!",

I do like that you can track your symptoms although I do not need it to open up a chat every single time to talk to me about what my symptoms mean I’m 40 not 15 years old. If I have questions I can always Google it. The ease of use and ability to adjust. Your dates is a lot easier than apples version and a few of the others that I’ve used. I like that I can track my symptoms and my birth control and I guess it could have even more ads as that seems to be the way that a lot of these applications have gone to. I just wish it would stop asking me every time I open the app if I was ready to upgrade. There doesn’t really seem to be a lot of benefit to upgrading my account from free. Maybe just ask once a month instead of every single time but then again, it’s your app and you can do what you want and I can always uninstall.",

It gives you options of how you feel, wether you’ve had sex, what type of discharge, and how heavy your flow was. The app cover is very discrete and quite cute. Keep in mind this is all the FREE version of the app. I’ve never had premium because the free portion is so great!",

        "內容": "I usually don’t review apps but i thought I have used this app long enough to review it. I started using this app in 2017 and i did switch between this app and another app to track my period. This app is by far a lot better then other it’s such a user friendly interface. Very easy to navigate and put in information. the first year i would say it was fine tuning my cycle and would be a couple days off. Now that it’s a couple years of information it’s spot on for when my period starts. If you have to go to a doctor a lot it’s nice to know exactly how long and when you had your period. I pay for the subscription but i would recommend it everyone it’s so worth it. I love that facts that it’s password protected so people can’t look at my information. I’m also close to a point in my life where i want to have children. Have ability to track my fertility window is so helpful. I also love the fact that it shows informational videos to help me understand what’s going on with my body and just learn things i wasn’t taught growing up. I also appreciate the notification it’s sends out a couple days before my period as a heads up that it’s about to start. Overall i love this app and would recommend it to everyone",

        "內容": "I wouldn’t mind paying for the app, but I would like to test it first to see if it’s worth the cost. That’s pretty hard to do with access to only 3-4 games. Also, the ads often don’t display the skip button (don’t know if this is a bug or intentional), so you’re forced to sit thorough ads that last minutes, or close out the app and hope the next ad isn’t also unskipable. Overall, I’d say this app isn’t worth paying for at the moment. Combine that with the free version being unbearable, and I don’t think Peak will be installed on my iPhone for very long. \n\nTo the devs: please save your canned reply. It means nothing to me and I’ll never come back to read it.\n\nEdit: I’m changing my rating to one star and deleting the app. The ads are excruciatingly long and often freeze, necessitating the restart of the app and another absurdly long ad.",

Again it’s really annoying, unnecessary because I’ve played it a bunch and known that by now, and makes me mess up the whole game because it messes me up and I have to click ‘okay’ to get it to go away and continue playing.

As a beginner it’s cumbersome to read the description of each game, understand what to do, then play the game. All this in order to keep your daily & weekly streak going. \nWhat I’m also trying to say is that each day should NOT be all new games to learn. Other brain games I play give you a few games to learn and play for a bit and then add on new games after that. Otherwise it’s just too much at one time. \nThank you for listening.",

There’s no way to report or contest it in-game. It has a game where you have to jump an elephant across a river of words. Not only are the connotations of many of those words subjective, but the elephant quite often just jumps in a random direction, regardless if you’re tapping the screen exactly the same way you were before. In the same vein, they have a coordination game where you can’t lift your fingers, only the right most control doesn’t sense a finger is there so keeps penalizing and never firing the ball. Then the overall score goes down because their game is faulty, making the brain score entirely useless. If you want to play without ads, get it for a month and then move on.

I decided to sign up for the free trial, and if I used it frequently during the week and saw some positive cognitive changes, I would stick with the annual subscription.

Often I want to take the picture and record the meal before I eat, but it won’t let you save the entry without rating how full I am. Is that possible to change? Maybe it could give you a reminder an hour later to fill that part in? 😁 thx! 🙏🏽",

Over the last 3 days it recorded nothing but stomach sounds and sheets moving. I sleep with my hands and watch next to my face and my partner tells me when I am talking more than this app does. I have a loud voice and speak full sentences, I can sometimes remember this. It may think I am awake, but I am unconscious. It does not record my talking for some reason. It has features like sounds to help fall asleep, and heart monitoring. But it has been unhelpful in monitoring talking. It may use heart rate to start recording, which isn’t accurate or helpful.",

Basically you are forced to sign up for the 7 day free trial of their premium subscription so that hopefully you’ll forget to cancel and then the developers can pull in money without you noticing. If there are free features they should be accessible without putting in payment info and the only reason to force a trial like this would be for monetary gain. Very greedy.

Every time you click on a day to view the details of your sleep- a pillow premium option pops up telling you to subscribe- there is no way around this.

Best of all, it is completely set up to take full advantage of my Apple Watch, iPhone and current iOS features.  Best of all,  the data can be downloaded and reviewed during my scheduled doctor visits.  I highly recommend this product.  Although weary of adding a new subscription based service I found that its benefits outweigh the cost of its nominal subscription fees.  Best of all, it lets you try before you buy with a free trial offer.",

I tried the app for 30 minutes, wasn’t my thing, deleted and canceled the subscription…less than 8 hours later, I find out that my account is OVERDRAWN because I was CHARGED! No free trial!! And Apple won’t refund it so now I can’t do ANYTHING on my phone because o owe money for an app I don’t even have! I’ve been fuming!! I’ve reported scam, fraud, and even called Apple customer service and their response “Nothing we can do; it’s a third party app.” So DO NOT TRUST THE FREE TRIAL OFFER!!! The app might be great, but I’m not rolling in money to be able to just be out $40+",

    "應用描述": "Your iPhone is always with you and makes a great step counter. \n\nAvailable on the iPhone and Apple Watch, Pedometer++ is the best way to review your step count, walking distance, active calories and heart rate data. \n\nSet a custom step count goal, and track your progress over time. The built-in graphs make reviewing your data easy and fun. Everyone loves awards, and Pedometer++ includes a range of Badges to motivate and reward your hard work! The app also totals how far you’ve walked each day, and even counts the flights of stairs you encounter each day.\n\nWith full-featured widget support, Pedometer++ can display your step count or update you on your daily progress right from the lock screen or home screen of your iPhone.\n\nThe Apple Watch app puts all this data on your wrist. With a wide range of Complications, it’s easy to check your progress with just a glance. Add a single Complication to your daily watch face, or add several to build a comprehensive fitness-focused look! \n\nDETAILS:\nFor best results, keep your iPhone on you as you move throughout the day, ideally in a pocket close to your hips. If you have an Apple Watch, you can set Pedometer++ to sync step data across your devices for the most accurate data possible.\n\nThe Apple Watch app can also be used to start and track both indoor and outdoor walking and running workouts and can serve as your guide while hiking.\n\n\nROUTES & MAPPING:\nPedometer++ is your ultimate companion for exploring the great outdoors. You can import GPX files for waypoints and routes set by others. \n\nYou can also use the app to create your own routes. Simply tap on your desired start and end points, and Pedometer++ will find the shortest route between them. You can then tweak the route based on terrain, trail popularity or personal preference. \n\nIn addition to the distance of a route, Pedometer++ shows the elevation changes you will encounter and the estimated time it will take you to reach your destination. You can also monitor the weather that is expected along your route.\n\nThe best part is that custom routing is available on the iPhone and Apple Watch. And of course, being out in nature often means losing cell service, so Pedometer++ allows you to download offline map data for large areas, not just data for your specific route. Offline map data is available on the iPhone and Apple Watch, as long as your Watch is within range of your phone.\n\n\nNOTES:\nPedometer++ integrates with the Apple Health app to collect and display step data collected by your Apple Watch. \n\nPedometer++ includes an optional premium subscription. This is offered on a monthly or annual basis. If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24 hours before the end of the current period. After purchase, you can turn off auto-renewal anytime by going to your Account Settings on the App Store.\n\nAccess to iPhone-based workout tracking is only available to Pedometer++ Premium subscribers.\n\n\nLEARN MORE:\nPrivacy Policy: https://pedometer.app/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://pedometer.app/terms",

I am an endurance athlete and have used multiple coaches, AI driven protocols, and work in healthcare and follow several exercise podcasts. \n\nThis app is good but if you try to use it for free, it is a bit frustrating with all the ads and pay walls. I have tried a few others including cycling specific coach driven strength workouts. I will likely stick with this for now. It does filter by equipment available well. If there was a better level of free workout routines, I would rate it higher.",

        "內容": "I have been using this app as a paid user for several years. Overall it is a great app, better than anything else I’ve seen. Mainly because the user interface is kept simple while working out, a simple tap to record a set, and a tone in my headphones when my rest timer is up. Easy to select, create, and modify workouts. Only small complaint about the app is that it sometimes freezes up while opening or ending a workout while trying to connect to their servers, if I have a bad internet connection… a function that adds zero value to my workout, as much as tech people think the world should come to a screeching halt if there’s no internet connection, I am capable of lifting weights without being online.\n\nMy one real issue, and the reason I’m knocking it down a star, is the Apple Watch interface. It does not coordinate with Apple Health at all (I realize this is probably Apple’s doing), and it frequently pauses or ends the watch Workout that I start to record the time and calories in the Apple daily health tracker. The Watch interface itself is annoying and buggy- if I try to use it to record a set, it often either doesn’t record it or records two sets- it doesn’t show and I still end up grabbing my phone. Then starting yesterday, it really went haywire, and the app kept popping up on my watch face trying to sync or start a new workout even after I confirmed I’d synced my last workout (again, could not care less if it syncs to some cloud, so long as the workout is saved on my phone) and force-closed the phone app. Ended up turning off the watch app completely because it got so annoying, to see it there every time I looked at my watch.",

So many workouts to choose from, or the ability to create my own. Can also modify preset workouts which I love. I really like how exercises are broken down into muscle groups in the library. Super helpful. My only thing would be that when I log my sets on my apple watch, the app on my phone doesn’t do my rest countdowns out loud. I keep the app open on my phone too. Not a major issue as my watch does vibrate when my time is up. Just odd that the 2 interact well otherwise. Anyhoo, loving my new workouts so far! Thanks Jefit!!",

My iPad while logged into the same account as my phone, does not sync up my workout plans.   If I edit something on my phone, my iPad even after resyncing doesn’t update.  Insane this basic thing doesn’t work, but don’t worry they’ll still hound you to upgrade to elite.  Keeping it a 2 star as they do allow you to stay on a free plan unlike other apps.",

        "內容": "Been using Calm for years. Absolutely love the daily calm & daily trip. They’re short, practical, and the daily releases mean I check in more often than I do in apps with static content catalogs. \n\nBUT the app has, ironically, slowly grown more and more stressful to use.  (The newest stressor: 3+ popups pushing me to share with a friend, every time I open the app.) For an app I come to when I’m stressed, the overwhelming amount of content and options is wild. The homepage is an endless scroll, there are settings buttons everywhere (scene, volume, favorite, download), and the logo awkwardly helps clutter the homepage too, especially on iPad. Frankly I wish I could select the features I use (daily calm/trip), hide the features I don’t want, and live life as a focused and happy customer. \n\nOne smaller request: Allow us to remove the default landscapes, and to upload our own! (Either just to our device, or ideally to a curated video marketplace—huge differentiator opp, in my opinion.) The default lake scenes are fake and cheesy, I wish I could remove them from my device and just keep 1 or 2 that bring me peace.",

It shows it right on my homepage. So it tells me to take a breath, and then it inundate me with the request to give a gift. I do not see how this induces an attitude of calming. Instead I said here feeling like I should give a gift to someone that I care about in the hopes that they could find some calm in their lives, while I become irritated with the fact that I paid for an app that still has, in my opinion, ads. I wish there was a way to get rid of this feature so that I can enjoy the app that I paid for, for the purpose of that I paid for without being bothered to give a subscription to someone else.",

I am 72 now but had stopped using a treadmill 12 years ago after serious illness with wife (coma,sepsis etc) when I stopped I was doing 40 minutes at speed of 4.3 for 45 minutes on incline of 13%. Twice a day. Sadly that was 12 years ago. With the help of homeTro I intend to get back to a healthy lifestyle.",

A few years ago it turned out a bunch of period and fertility apps were selling women’s data to various companies. I did a deep dive on this app and from what I could find, this is one of the only major apps that was NOT selling our data.\nOne major thing that could make this app better is if it offered a mean, median, and mode for length of cycle. I think it just bases your cycle length off your last cycle. But each ovary is different, and I wish the app accounted for that, too. Each of my ovaries behaves slightly differently, so Every other month I have a slightly different experience and length of cycle (by like 1 or 2 days). Most of these apps are basically counters, calculators, and storage, so I don’t see why different types of averages couldn’t be included, as well as accounting for each ovary having different indicators/symptoms and lengths of cycles.\nOverall great experience!",

This app will make you pay for exercises you can find on YouTube or Pinterest so I advise people to not buy their overpriced bundles and what not.

        "內容": "I really love this app and the concept; however, get frustrated by the integration of the HR zones with my other apps. The bulk of my workouts are done at Orange Theory where I wear a heart rate monitor that tracks my HR the entire workout. Unfortunately, this HR data does not fully transfer to the Gentler Streak app, which eliminates the purpose of this app as an exertion/recovery-based indicator. \n\nAs an example, Gentler Streak typically only collects my HR data for ~30-50% of my Orange Theory workouts.\n\nThese challenges could be avoided with a manual input of the % spent in each HR zone (this would be in addition to the perceived exertion).",

It looks too simplistic - as the metrics are mostly abstracted away, but that is the beauty of this app.  The novelty of having “all of the data” has worn off for me after a few weeks with other metric heavy apps.  Gentler Streak provides a meaningful daily summary that actually motivates me.  I also like the design, whimsical characters, and colors.  At the end of the day this app provides me with what I truly need - a summary of my recovery plus just the metrics I care about.  I appreciate the workout suggestions even if I can’t always follow them due to schedule.  Strangely this app actually has changed my mental state with regard to resting.  I no longer feel lazy if I don’t work out on a given day - especially if GS has indicated I should rest.   A win for mental health!",

Reassuring and helpful when reviewing my metrics, how I feel, and how that compares to the data it collects and displays. I really like the improvement in sleep info that it displays. It shows some additional info vs Apple’s standard Health app, so it’s definitely helpful.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s helpfulness is marred by unreliable mirror tracking - which for me, was the primary reason I bought the app. Mirror tracking lets me see on my iPhone workout data that’s being collected from the watch. It works maybe 50% of the time. Sure, restarting my watch and phone will fix the problem, but that’s a lengthy process especially once I’ve got setup and am ready to workout. Don’t add another barrier to me working out! The problem has been happening for some time, so I’m hoping they can get it fixed. Or hopefully Apple makes mirror tracking native for all their workouts and not just cycling and I won’t have to deal with the frustration of using Gentler Streak.",

I did end up letting the subscription expire because I feel I have a better handle on my own training load now. On the positive, the app is well designed and I do feel like it was pretty decent at knowing when I needed to work vs rest, especially at first. However, once I got in a routine of regular workouts, it kept telling me to work harder to maintain my streak. Doing 30-60 minutes of strength training 3-4x per week and walking a lot seems like it should be plenty to keep me fit, but once Gentler Streak adapted to that routine, it started pushing me to do more and more in a way that felt unsustainable. \n\nI just returned from a 10-day trip to Europe, where we walked minimum 20K steps a day. I know the point of the app is to add more than just apple’s rings, but throughout that entire trip, the messages kept telling me to work out more and eventually “lost” my streak. I don’t mind that of course, but it’s wild that it can’t consider that I was walking 10 miles a day. \n\nI also think it’s absurd that period tracking isn’t included in the free version.

The app does not sync on Strava or any other major \"social fitness\" platform. In 2024 this is really unacceptable. Everyone is connected and we like to maintain the social pressure as part of our motivation for working out. Just this flaw will translate in me not using Gentle Streak on the apple watch to track the runs, meaning that I am not able to use the great \"body battery\" indicator... \n\n2. The app is awesome to give you information on what to do today. It does not provide you with an upcoming plan for the week/month. That would be great to prepare properly and, if needed, organize the agenda accordingly. We are all busy and the possibility to prepare an adjustable plan will be more than welcome.\n\nThere are pros and cons in every app, but these 2 items (particularly #1) are so annoying that I wonder if I should maintain the subscription....",

        "內容": "I love this app and I am a long time subscriber, but it misses a huge part of my physical activity.\n\nAs I’ve seen in other reviews and in a support request, the developers dismiss the idea of using the data collected in Apple’s “Move” and “Exercise” rings. Only tracked workouts are taken into account.\n\nThe app uses the Training Impulse (TRIMP) method to quantify the training load and stress placed on an athlete's body during exercise with the (admittedly) more accurate workout data.\n\nHowever, ignoring all of the other physical activity that we do means that when we have an above average day of non-workout activity, the app’s recommendation is no different and it asks us to push too hard during our workouts.\n\nThe developers dig their heels in over not being able to use the less accurate non-workout data to determine the toll that this activity has on our bodies, but they already use: sleeping heart rate, sleep duration, wrist temperature, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation to estimate our overall wellbeing. These don’t fit anywhere in the TRIMP formula and are imperfect data that creates an imperfect estimate.\n\nI appreciate the developers’ goal of using a science and data backed approach to be sure that their app serves and protects us. I hope that they can find a way to bring the same rigor to expand the capability of the app to bring non-workout activity into the fold to provide a better picture of our workouts, overall activity, and recovery.",

Second is dog walking activity, as it seems that they just renamed it and took all the parameters from walking one.

I didn't think there would be an app that would perfectly meet my needs, but this one does. Perfect and worth the 3.99 for the paid app that lets you have more than five reminders.\n\nUpdate after lots of use: The only reason I dropped my rating to five stars is that really often when I check off a task it stays frozen, that is shifted right with the check mark displayed. I have eight habits and it never makes it through all eight without freezing. To get it to register that the habit was done I need to hard close the app and relaunch it. That is a small daily annoyance that I end up doing a couple times each day. \n\nBesides that, in terms of function and design, this is by far the best app I’ve found, which is why I stick with it despite the minor annoyance of having to hard close it to register which habits are checked off.",

While the app works about 85% of the time, it occasionally breaks streaks without reason, experiences significant lag, and has no way to sync with its web version, as confirmed by customer service. Despite these issues, I might overlook them, but the $80 annual fee just isn’t justified.",

I used this app many many years ago, and paid for a subscription way back when. When I reinstalled it recently, all features were available.

A habit tracker where I can actually analyze the data to see which habits I still need to work on. \n\nI gave it 4 stars because I’ve been having issues with its timer feature. If I turn on the timer and move to another app, the timer stops working. If I play music or a video, the timer stops working. It’s very frustrating especially since I like using its Pomodoro feature to complete tasks. It throws my data off. \n\nAnother feature that needs to be fixed is displaying data if you completed some of the work. There are some goals that are time based. For example, if the goal is 30 minutes a day, but you only completed 20 minutes. It would be nice to see it in the stats section. You only see if it is completed or not on the calendar even though you have a symbol for some done. \n\nAdditionally, I wish I could export my data to an excel file. If I’m tracking my goals this would take it to the next level.\n\nI know that many have complained about the price increase. I am paying about $35 a year for it. This is pricey but I think it’s worth it. Now if it jumps up to $80 that would be really steep.",

        "內容": "I will let the results speak for themselves. The first time I used this before going to bed, I slept for almost 8 hours (from 3 hours normally) and the following night over 11 hours. \n\nI have had other white noise apps before, however they are more distracting as I can hear when the sound loop repeats every time. This app doesn’t suffer from that issue. It has made a significant impact on my sleeping quality and length. I have not tried any of the other uses for the app yet, but much appreciate the Sleep mode that does work well for me.",

        "內容": "Even with a 30% discount, $7 a month is wildly overpriced. $5 month a la cart or cheaper with annual subscription is more in line with the simplicity of this app. \n\nNeat app, but the developers need a reality check overcharging for beeps and boops. \n\nAs of late, basic Free functionality has crippled the app in an attempt to stiff arm you into purchasing a subscription. \n\nConsider making an option for one time purchase even, but a subscription for this is laughably out of touch with reality. Best of luck.",

I recently went through some issues with my phone where I lost all my apps. When I went to redownload this app, it had totally changed and now will only give you 10mins of sound before shutting off, and if you want more, you have to pay for premium. To my embarrassment, I had just recommended this app to a friend who struggles like me, and had to reach out and apologize to her, saying I didn’t know it had changed. She told me she had tried it, but with it shutting off all the time, defeated the purpose for her. And I agree.",

Your subscriptions are predatory at best, $100 a year just so we have the ability/comfort to focus on basic everyday tasks that neurotypicals can just do without help.

And this is an app made for neurodivergent people, yet most ND people (including myself) are below the poverty line and thus can’t even afford or have the luxury to pay for the full experience.

I understand it’s meant to be a game, but it feels like a Wii game from the 2000s, and because of that, doesn’t feel like a serious training app. For some reason, you also need a secondary companion app to sync with Strava and other third party services. \n\nI want to be able to control the typography, HUD, guidance notices, and more. They pack too much stuff on the screen while you ride and riders should be able to control this for maximum effect. On my iPad Air, I can’t even make out what some of the stuff says. There wasn’t much consideration for device screen size scaling. And I can’t enjoy what little of the course I see.\n\nIf my employer didn’t cover the cost, I probably wouldn’t be using it.",

Certainly this is no replacement for outdoor riding, but one of the best things I ever heard a professional rider say was quantity outside and quality inside. I am a beginner to intermediate rider, one full Iron Man and one Olympic triathlon. But I feel like I’ve gotten much stronger using Zwift.",

To help this I ended up getting zwift and the zwift ride.  It took 2 weeks to really get into it.  Even still, out of saddle I still struggle a bit on the ride machine.   Since getting used to zwift, I have only take my bike out twice in a month vs 20+ days in a month.  I don’t want to go outdoors anymore.  So much work and time to prepare.  At home I jump on, off, see my kids who love to watch my races.  It’s a major game changer.  I also went from a 245ftp to 279 in a month.  The last road ride I did equaled 20+ ftp too.  I had so much power and with zwift, mainly because you don’t coast like you do on roads.  Zero crashes or bad experiences at all.   Well outside being ranked at a certain ftp and seeing guys steadily double it in races.",

I have an Apple Watch Ultra 2. If this remains an issue, I will 100% start trying other services. I have been loyal to Zwift for the last year or so but definitely starting to second guess this loyalty. This issue seems to only be getting worse",

I have no way to “forget” or remove his equipment from mine to make it stop doing this. Would be great if I was able to at least make my equipment the default and have it stop auto connecting to his - especially in the middle of his rides.

        "內容": "Zwift is the ultimate for indoor training.  I’ve used various types of trainers before smart trainers were an option.  The old way was boring and challenging.  Zoom to the current status of trainers:  Smart trainers are awesome as they respond to virtual terrain, yes the uphill grades.  Also, when you shift to a big gear and crank out the watts if shows on your avatar speed.\n\nZwift is the ultimate platform.  Others have tried but they mimic and fall short.  Zwift has the long term experience and the largest bulk of subscribers to create something that is absolutely engaging.  You feel literally transported to Watopia—The Zwift Cycling World.  It’s too cool, you see folks from all over the world cycling there.  You can go free-style and just ride. Or, you can enter a race, a group ride, or a workout.  Zwift has it all!  \n\nIf you want to be consistent, Zwift is a great option as you simple jump on your bike & trainer, then go.  Also, for those of us who deal with harsh winters, Zwift allows us to have fun, train and maintain or build our fitness during the snow & ice.  \n\nI’ve purchased Zwift Trainers for 3 of my adult kids and they thank me regularly.  Even my wife who used to despise indoor trainers thoroughly enjoys and utilizes Zwift.  Thanks Zwift!",

You can write in all those notes after you’ve logged your weight. \nAnyways, it shows ALL your weight data on a continuous line graph. You have the option to view the graph by day, week, month, 90 days, 180 days, 1 year, and 3 years, and you can scroll to see more of your data. Oh, you can have a target weight and it will appear as a dotted line on your graphs and when you input your weight a banner at the top tells you how much weight you’ve lost or gained since the last time you logged weight and it also tells you how close you are to your target weight. Anyways its super easy and great, and i love having so much data on it so i can see how my weight changes, and even recognize some patterns.",

        "內容": "I’m a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) and I’m always looking for simple and easy to use, yet detailed weight tracking apps that display overall trends. Out of ~40+ that I’ve tried this one is definitely my favorite. I use it myself and recommend it to my patients that like using apps to keep track of their weight (some people still like paper). \nI completely agree with the app developer on the importance of looking at weight change trends. Looking at a weight at one point in time isn’t very valuable whereas trends are key to showing both short and long term success or it might show that you need to consider making a change, come up with a plan or reevaluate the current plan. It’s easy for people to look at a graph trend and see the big picture. A list of numbers isn’t as easy to comprehend. I also love the automatic BMI calculation. Most people don’t know how to calculate their BMI. \nOverall, this app is amazing. You can change what it looks like - I wish the app icon would change to the one I chose for the inside (wood isn’t cute at all). Another thing I love is the little Kawaii bear and how colorful the app is. The keypad where you type your weight is huge and easy to see. This app is SOOO easy to use, there’s pretty much nothing you need to learn since it’s self explanatory. It works great, it’s fast and I’ve never had any problems with it. I love that you can go back and enter previous weights and the date, etc. You can put notes in too - for ex: if you entered your weight for the day and your goal is weight loss. If today’s weight is up a few pounds from last week - you can put a note in as to why it’s up or what you think may have caused it to increase. For me, one time mine went up several pounds and I knew it would bec I’d just gotten back from vacation and wasn’t eating as healthy as I normally do so thankfully I put that in the note and if I ever need to look back and wonder why my weight went up, I can click on it and my notes pops up. I also use the notes section for tracking my temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Also if you weighed yourself on a different scale (at the gym vs at home or the doctors office, etc. you can put that in the note too). This is SUCH a nice feature :)\nOverall I highly recommend this app. It’s the best I’ve used and I love it so much! \n\nRecommendations for the developer:\n•Can you please let me add another person (technically my cat). I’m keeping track of her weight and I already have mine in there. I don’t want to add her weights into mine bec the trend chart would be a mess. I would love to be able to add a second person (or cat) :)\n•Can you please add more options for what it looks like. I do like some of the options but the options are limited. Wether free or paid, I’d love to have more options.\n•If this is even possible (I’m not app developer so I have no idea) - are you able to change the app icon to make it the same color/design as the one I’m using on the inside? I REALLY don’t like wood and it ruins the cute little bear bec wood is so yuck. That’s the first thing I changed when I got the app was the wood. I know a lot of other people feel the same way. \n\nThank you for creating such a wonderful app. It’s so easy, but still has the important information I need for myself and patients. I love how you encourage people to look at overall trends rather than the number. Also - sooo many apps in the US only have the option of entering weight in pounds. I hate looking at my weight in pounds. So thank you for letting me use kg instead. \nI know this app is for adults but since you already have the kg option you should consider adding growth charts too and make it for infants and pediatrics too (or even pediatrics would be awesome). Add the WHO growth charts for 0-3yrs and the CDC ones for 2-20yrs. In the pediatric hospital and at pediatrician offices, they use kg and cm. In all pediatric settings they use kg and cm vs adults use lb and inches. Except for some adults (like me) who prefer looking at the smaller number (kg) rather than pounds, lol! I love your app and I hope you expand it further someday so I can use it for my infant and pediatric patients who use growth chart percentiles rather than the adult BMI standards. Thank you SO much, your app is my favorite :)\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP:\nThis app is AMAZING!!!!! As an RDN and CDE, I highly recommend it to everyone - whether your trying to lose, gain weight or maintain your weight, it’s the perfect app to use. This app gives you a lot of data considering how easy it is to just type your weight in. The flexibility and customization is so nice and above the rest of the apps out there. \nI LOVE IT and you will too!",

        "內容": "This is the best, most calming game ever. I started off thinking that this would be a bad, boring game. And as someone who has bad anxiety and boredom problems, I generally enjoyed this game. All of the little complements and little calming comments, make me smile every time, sometimes even with a little chuckle. The music is amazing, and the animals are so adorable and loving. I love waiting for the next little quest to do, and this generally helps a whole lot with anxiety. 5 stars, no complaints.",

The only down sides have been that then Game Center Achievements and then game are not connected so I have not gotten a bunch of the ones I should have by now. Also the remembrance pieces really shouldn’t be used for more things as you earn them far too easily and they are used for all of one thing and then you just build up too many once you have maxed out that whole area. Other than those things it is a great game to help you get to sleep or just relax through the day.",

It’s not like Hole.io, or something like that. If you want treasure from a treasure chest, you can either pay 300 gems for it, (not real money I think this game does not thrive on that) or watch an ad. The ads aren’t even that bad. They’re not INVOLUNTARY if you like ads, get a game like hole.io. This games graphics are so smooth too. It’s giving kind of an origami vibe…? Like.. so so so aesthetically pleasing.

I have never seen such great and fast progress, and for such affordable price. My body looks so much different, I’m toned, healthier, and have improved my endurance enormously. I love the programs because they organize your workout schedule for you with a specific objective in mind (6 pack, losing weight, build muscle, core with Pilates…). If I could suggest something would be to add some class style workouts (not just static + YouTube videos), and to let you move the workouts directly from the month schedule (not individually with each workout in a specific program). I’m really satisfied, and I’m pretty sure I’ll be renewing my year membership!",

I love how as you are following the workout videos, the voice of a trainer is coaching and motivating you. It really makes my day. If I were to change anything about the app, I would change the lengths of the water breaks during the workouts. They are way too short. For some, you only get 10 seconds to grab your water and chug it before the next exercise. I hope the developers will read this and take it into account. Overall, good assortment of workouts and challenges.",

        "內容": "This is the first and only fitness app I’ve ever downloaded, but because the app is so easy to use, offers a low subscription rate allowing access to routines available from real trainers including detailed trainer information & credentials, offers thoroughly coached and cued exercise routines, as well as plenty of free exercises Both of which you can repeat time and time again to see and compare your progress. The app also provides an interface to create and publish your own personalized routines and integrates easily with my mobile technology which allows me to view my workout progress and history. \n\nA couple minor Issues I recommend changes... The “alarm” icon could be colored red or yellow when an alert badge shows up on the icon, Settings and preferences could be easier to find and use, and the social networking tools are a little cumbersome. I like the ability to use the social media functions on the app to avoid the main stream social media and the “eye-roll” judgment from friends who don’t exercise. But, since these are hardly the focus of the app I consider these to be minor issues. \n\nFrom my experience using this app the priority seems to be appropriately focused on providing an interface for trainers and exercisers with a vast array of free workouts, and — until you subscribe — a modest (and expected) delay for advertising. I believe functions and features supporting background information and social media-type functions will improve as they gain more use; conversely, I could see an increase in their use resulting from improving these functions and feature as well. \n\nMeanwhile I give the app “two enthusiastic thumbs up”",

When an add plays the x to get out of it when finished is under the battery/WiFi/signal indicator on the top right of my iPhone 12.  I can’t press the x in that area, because of the other stuff.

There also needs to be an option to turn on real-time, verbal instructions for each exercise so you don’t have to read each exercise before a workout to learn new exercises and to make sure you are learning, following, and continuing to implement proper form for each exercise as you progress.\n\nOverall, I like the app. But there are no mobility or flexibility routines built in. And no warm-ups. This creates problems down the road, and it would be nice not to have to use a different app or set of videos for this before and after the workouts on this app.\n\nThere are also no assessments or graphs of your progress. Other paid apps have these useful tools.\n\nSome of the GIFs are wrong. The “glute bridge” shows the shoulders and arms in red as if they are being engaged. But the exercise is supposed to focus on the glutes. This is very misleading.",

But last night he noticed it was missing. We looked… and looked … and looked… yeah no success by looking. My dad had the brilliant idea of asking google cause google smart. google said a random bluetooth finder app so thats how we came across this app. at first we thought our dog ate it because she was moving with the pencil, but no chance. When we got to the kitchen it was WAY CLOSER but still too far. We looked in the cars because it was close to them, but no luck. After that we charged the iPad and ate dinner. Oh, but what does dad see? The pencil RIGHT BEHIND WERE WE WERE LOOKING!!! at least we found under the kitchen table and not been gulped up by my dogs. The real problem was, that I was right behind the pencil but it said 30 FT away. More like 2 FT away. Mid.",

I thought it’s slipped off and been left at the laundry mat since that’s when I noticed it was gone not to mention I manually logged my workout so it wasn’t giving me an accurate last location. I hoped I took it off wit my other jewelry but it was not with the rest. I almost lost hope until I down loaded the app and it picked up that the ring was indeed in my apartment. The radar increased near my laundry but I put away my laundry and still no ring. Then I noticed the trash was next to the baskets and yes the radar increased even more. I nearly have a trash phobia and I only had a few days left before the ring’s battery died so I got the gloves, Clorox, soapy water, and extra garbage bags and build the courage. Honestly I was partly motivated to see if the radar was accurate and sure enough Lord behold, it led me TIGHT to my Oura ring!!! I didn’t even have to dig deep! Washed it bleached it and VOILA it’s like new! Saved me $700 for a new one being how my warranty had JUST expired two weeks ago. This app is SURE to stay!",

I checked my Bluetooth menu in Settings and my Pencil was connected, so it must be nearby. I looked around everywhere and couldn’t find it, so I installed this app. Well, guess what? The Apple Pencil didn’t pop up in the devices menu at ALL. And yes, I did walk around.\nFast forward to about 10 minutes later, I stopped looking due to frustration and then I find the Pencil, just nearby in open sight. I hadn’t went to that area so maybe that was why it wasn’t popping up in the devices area.\nI bring my Pencil right next to my tablet, and then I test whether or not it shows up in the devices menu. It still doesn’t, despite it being about 2 inches from my tablet. Incredible…",

There is nothing special about the workouts. If you’re someone like me who already frequent the gym and already had a set workout routine then this is useless. Basically if you already know what you’re doing in the gym then don’t bother. If it was free maybe but it’s not worth the money. And the nerve to be charging $100 🙄. Needless to say I cancelled the same day. I wish there were more honest reviews to save me money.",

If you do then you can no longer rely on just the app to track your progress, which is a large part of its purpose. As an iOS developer it wouldn’t be difficult to implement. People suggest it to them quite often but I’m not sure they listen to their customers. It appears all their updates are quite random and don’t ever address what the consumer base necessarily desires, but at least they actively work on the app. Other than that, the app is far better than the few other paid apps I checked out. It would be worth trying the app out with their free trial",

It even switches up the exercises routine for me in the intervals I want. The progression feature is pretty good also (their working on further improving this). The swap out options are also great because they are narrowed down to options that target the area you are working on so your not overwhelmed. The customer service is also phenomenal. Response time and support on how to navigate the app is greatly appreciated! If you need some structure and help in finding a workout plan….. Gym Streak is a GREAT investment!!!!",

        "內容": "I was excited to try this app after seeing the advertised price of $29.99 per year ($2.48/month). However, I was charged $3.99 instead, which doesn’t align with the pricing they promoted. This feels deceptive and misleading, as there’s no clear explanation for the discrepancy.\n\nCustomers deserve transparency and honest pricing. If there are hidden fees or other charges, they should be disclosed upfront. This kind of practice damages trust and makes me hesitant to continue using the service or recommend it to anyone.\n\nI’ve reached out to support to resolve this, but so far, the experience has been frustrating. If you’re considering this program, beware of the unclear billing practices.",

However, the latest upgrade has locked out my prior fitness data, and removed access to custom built workouts and all access to any pre-built workout without a monthly subscription. It’s very disappointing. I hate monthly subscriptions, and would rather have the option to pay a higher fee up front. That’s what I did several years ago when I first bought the app. These ‘bug fixes’ are not a feature. It’s to force customers to pay monthly to get access to what they already paid for.",

The bugs that are very irritating is, after an exercise the app shuts down completely and you have to relaunch it. When you choose a time to exercise it keeps resetting to 31 minutes. Every single exercise you have to keep messing with this over and over until it finally works. I lose about 5-10 mins by messing with the bugs each time I exercise. It keeps reminding me that I haven’t exercised in days when really I exercise everyday. The only good thing about this app now is that the membership is cheap, just like the effort put into it.

        "內容": "I download this app because I wanted something that could basically be a personal trainer in app form. I’m not new to the gym and meal prepping but it requires a lot of energy to do on your own. I’m a full time student and have a full time job on top of that, so I was looking for something that required a little less thinking on my part and something I could just easily follow. \n\n***I spent a couple hours going through this app to get everything set up and here are my initial thoughts:\n\nThis app promotes that it builds workout plans and meal plans based on your needs. Although it does do this to a certain extent, the app is not fluid with itself. \n\nPros:\n\nIt has a huge plethora of exercises to choose from and you can pick target areas and it will bring up a great range of exercises that use equipment or body weight. So if you want to build your own workouts this is an awesome feature. \n\nIf your not looking for an app to do all the thinking for you and you like to customize everything it has a ton of resources. \n\nThe recipes are super easy to follow and nutritional facts are provided.\n\nYou can also allow this app to share with the health app on the iPhone which I really liked. \n\nFor beginners who just want to start somewhere, there is a lot of useful tools in this app. \n\nCons: \n\nMy first issue is that the meal planning doesn’t coincide with your workout plan. My initial desire for this app was to have a meal plan based around my gym routine. It feels as if the app doesn’t communicate with itself in that way. So for heavy lifting days it still gives me the same amount of protein and carbs as my rest days.\n\nMy second issue is the provided workout plans don’t give you enough detail about which plan to choose. I suppose I could just trial and error what works for me, but I don’t like feeling like I’m wasting my time hoping I’m going to see specific results and not doing the correct work to accomplish that. There is a small test that prompts when you open this tab, but I suppose I was expecting something more personalized. \n\nAnother issue I had was the meal plans. When I first logged into the app, I looked at the different meal plans available and there is a very good range to work with, from vegetarian and vegan to clean eating to fasting to keto and paleo, to high protein or low sodium. So i was really happy initially with all the options. Once I went into my settings tab to customize what my goals were, my meal plans were restricted to keto, paleo, and the low sodium diet. I haven’t found an option to reset the settings, and I don’t like that I no longer have access to the other meal plan options. You can retake the meal plan test but I changed up my answers and still got the same results. \n\nIt’s only 30$ a year so I’m not super mad I subscribed to this for a year, just isn’t fluid for what I thought it was. And it’s not the most user friendly. \n\nI was really hoping to get a meal plan that tailored to my gym routine out of the same app but I might have to go back to having them split to two apps. \n\n****I’m going to try to utilize what I can from this app for a couple months and may end up updating my review.",

Also there are so few exercises! Need more body weight options and stability ball options! Adding in a custom exercise is time consuming, so I’m not going to do it anymore.

Wouldn’t recommend for those with little to no experience or research into lifting and who don’t know exactly what they want. Would also like more specific descriptions of which muscle the exercise is hitting (ex: just shoulders vs anterior delts). Also, a dark mode would be nice. In general, very few complaints and an extremely underrated app.",

        "內容": "This app says it’s free, but from an economic perspective (or any real perspective!!) it’s not. The sounds don’t work at all, regardless of where they are free or not. The sound library is full of sounds, true, but NONE of them are free. So basically, with the free option, you have, like, 5 sounds that are not even creative. Woods? Really? Secondly, the slimes that are premade are all VIP only. The only one that is free to use is the very first one I think. It was literally free for 2 days though, so no promises… Even the pre made slimes with gibits (the little things that look like donuts that you put inside?) so you can only make your own. Thirdly, the make your own quality is not very very good, and the graphics are ok. Like, the colors are sort of diluted and grayish except for the blueberry cyan one. Not very pretty options basically, and they all feel the same, regardless of your material. The on,y reason I gave two stars is because the theme and texture of the slime is pretty cool. Even if the texture does not change AT ALL when you use glue or water, as appused to to borax and soap. Very disappointed. Unless you want to pay, don’t get this",

It used to be a good, solid way to keep track of every night's sleep and be able to compare them over the years.  But the vendors have caved in to the temptation to make everything really fancy without adding useful features.\nA few of the problems:\nIt is not possible to see the graphs in the horizontal format, which renders impossible reading any information from over a long period (e.g., ten years).  It is  not possible to compare two years, or five.  One cannot choose the measurements to view.  What used to be a straightforward, very informative graph of a night's sleep is now an appallingly tricked up mess of alarming colors, viewable only in the short format, not in horizontal mode.  And not transferable to a bigger screen, such as a desktop.  I have been assured that it is not possible to go back to the old graph.\nThis was a wonderful app until they had delusions of grandeur and went fancy, instead of making their product more flexible and therefore more useful.",

It is well worth the money since it’s so interesting, and you don’t have to use any type of wearable tracking device (huge perk since I don’t want to wear a watch or ring to bed!)\nI am able to see my nights sleep laid out, which had been beneficial to my goal to improve my quality of sleep.\n\nMy one and only issue is, no matter what, it will say it takes me an average of 1 hour to fall asleep. This is not true! I am a person how knocks out the second my head hits the pillow. This reading affects my sleep “score” because for example it will say I slept for a total of 6 hours and 31 minutes, and took me 1 hour and a half to fall asleep. So in reality, I slept for almost 8 hours, but it only logs 6 and a half. I don’t really know why it won’t register how fast I am falling asleep, and it’s frustrating to be told I slept over an hour less, which isn’t the case. \n\nOverall I love this app and will continue to use it nightly. It’s fun!",

This app allows max 90mins IN the app. And if I play it outside the app, the alarm noise doesn’t work in the morning, instead it just increased my white noise app sound to disturbing and confusing levels. (Wasn’t sure what was happening so I kept turning it down every ten minutes until I opened my phone a few times later!!\n2- Edit sleep time? Or “Go back to sleep” button? I sometimes choose to sleep longer after the alarm. How do I “go back to sleep” or edit my sleep log after it’s been recorded. Now the data is inaccurate and says I only slept 4hrs and woke up at 6am. When the reality is, the alarm was going on and off through my white noise sound for 30 mins and I was so frustrated, when I eventually turned it off I went back to sleep for an hour and a half. But I can’t edit my sleep log?",

Sleep Cycle shows 1 hour 52 minutes for last night.  My other apps show 5 minutes.  I know I fell asleep quickly because I was very tired.  The update also changed my wake up sound.\n\nI have been in contact with support and they are insisting that there is nothing wrong with the app.  I have been using the app for nearly 11 years.  My time to fall asleep is usually under 10 minutes.  Nothing has changed in my environment.  The only change is the last update.",

Now, it constantly crashes in the middle of the night after tracking for 30 minutes or so, leaving me with no alarm for the morning.

The intelligent snooze feature used to work very well and was the main reason I used this over a typical alarm. Now, most mornings the alarm just goes off at the end of the wake up phase.\n\nReaching out to app support was no help. When I told them that the issue still persists (and has gotten worse), even after troubleshooting, they said, “If our app doesn’t register you as in light sleep or awake it will ring at the end of the wake-up window.” However, I have instances where (according to the graph) I am in a light sleeping phase throughout the snooze period, and it still does not go off until the last minute.\n\nI also reached out to support about restoring my online backup, which is now “expired.” I paid for the app once, and have always been able to restore my data with the online backup when I switched devices. The support person insisted I must have paid for a monthly or yearly subscription in order to access the online backup, although they have no record of my having paid for a subscription. The constant ads to upgrade to premium first thing in the morning are the icing on the cake, as I can’t imagine wanting to pay more for an app that does not deliver on its promises.",

I’ve used the app for years, but other companies are doing it better.  Lots of features simply don’t work anymore.  The phase wake-up just wakes you up at the beginning of the alarm cycle, the hue component doesn’t work anymore.  They should work on getting the basics down and figuring out how to keep their old customers business instead of switch models after making it a one time purchase.  I bought the app, now I can’t use all the features.  Shame.",

        "內容": "Exceeds Lumosity, honest company. Does what they say with you money, appropriaurtimeyoupurchase.  Discounts but better puzzles. Really races the kind. Keeps you sharp and focused.  NOT the sane 3-4-5 ring around the roses  Lumosity has. \nYou REALLY have to think and act...usually FART and faster, but makes adjustments so you’re not wasting your time and money.  Challenges you, but not frustrating. It’s a FUN CHALLENGE. \nI’ve paid for (Lumosity twice, ripped off both times) I’d  PAY, P A Y, PAY for this 3x before I’d take a membership for life (which they SAY they don’t have) from Lumosity).  Fixed income, SHORT on money, but I just renewed the second time for another year.  \nWrong about 100x  better....1000x better than Lumosity.....even if Lying Lumosity Gave you a year.  \n\nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE Geist, MUUUUUUCH better than the free and ESPECIALLY the cheap, non challenging Lymosity, AND their customer services ALL LIES!   Even if you get switched to a “higher up”, they just make up a higher-up, bigger LIE! And if you can prove that wrong, they change their lie! \nN E V ER, NEVER, NEEEEEVER had a problem with Giest (this program!) \n\nIf they were in school....this would be a Doctoralproframlumosityeiupd have failed pre-school. \n\nOh, btw.....this app is ANAZING!\nLUMOSITY LIES! And Lurs, and they do t tell the truth, they maieupfzjestr\nIris’s, then give you someone new for a new version of lies, they aren’t honest, they don’t tell the truth, theyfub, they fabricate their lies quickly, they rip you off $$ they aren’t truthful, they LIE and BTW....Lumosity should be called LiarOhSoBad.  Lies so ouch, you’d think it was started at tRump University.  \n\nBut this one, Giest beats the snot out of Liarosoty in E ERYWAY. \n\nThis app is fantastic, honest, challenging, truthful, fair, ok.....I’ll stop.  \n\nPS: Lumosity LIES!!!!!!!!   And they aren’t honest.  \n\nBe smart, before you start  training...go with this one.",

    "應用描述": "全球6000,000,000人在用的科學減肥方法！\n這是根據風靡全球的間歇性斷食法（Intermittent Fasting，“輕斷食”）而打造出的一款簡單、實用的健康減肥APP。\n\n還在戒糖戒碳？身體在被損耗！加入輕斷食，和我們一起重塑健康飲食習慣。\n延緩衰老：禁食到達一定階段，細胞開啟自噬，對抗老起重要作用。 （該理論獲2016年諾貝爾生理學獎）\n\n什麼是間歇性斷食？\n間歇性斷食是科學規劃進食時間，什麼時間段內可以吃，什麼時間段內不吃。它不限制可選擇的食物範圍，更不是完全禁食、什麼都不吃。\n\n什麼是斷食計劃？\n常見的斷食計劃有14:10，16:8，20:4等等。最受歡迎的168，代表不吃東西的時間段長度是16小時，能吃東西的時間段長度是8小時，即如果早上10點吃第一餐，那麼傍晚6點是最後一餐。\n\n間歇性斷食有效果嗎？\n有效果。輕斷食迎合了低熱量的飲食趨勢與習慣，通過限制進食窗口，能有效降低體內血糖和胰島素水平，保持最佳身心狀態。同時，斷食期間隨著糖原的消耗，身體會進入酮症狀態，開啟人體的“脂肪燃燒”模式。\n\n間歇性斷食簡單嗎？\n簡單。您可能並不知道，斷食窗口中大部分時間都是在睡眠中度過的。通過有意識的認知到斷食窗口和進食窗口的存在，能培養科學健康的飲食習慣。\n\n間歇性斷食安全嗎？\n安全。間歇性斷食是一種順從自然的飲食生活習慣方法。持續性進食會使身體器官一直忙碌於處理消化食物的過程，而斷食期間，肝臟等內臟器官得以休養生息。\n\n我適合間歇性斷食嗎？\n輕斷食APP內有多種斷食方案，適合各類人群。不管您是新手還是有輕斷食經驗的人，APP都能細心引導你完成。科學進行間歇性斷食，讓您3天發現身體的改變！\n\n輕斷食APP如何幫助您間歇性斷食\n\n斷食指南\n- 個性化斷食計劃：涵蓋當今火爆全球的14種熱門輕斷食方案，如：16/8、14/10、18/6、20/4；\n- 全方位斷食指導：在斷食過程中，我們將全程指引輔導，並提供記錄追踪功能。何時開始、何時結束，讓您每一次的禁食數據都做到一目了然；\n- 身體狀態追踪：隨著禁食時間，APP會提示您身體狀況各階段將產生的變化，如：血糖水平、糖原儲備、生酮狀態，代謝情況等。\n\n斷食工具\n- 數據追踪：體重記錄、飲水、步數等數據的記錄功能，隨時記錄查看身體數據；\n- BMI：自動計算BMI，幫助選擇最適合自身的斷食方案；\n- 同步數據：打開“Apple Health”同步開關，同步您的身高、體重、體脂、活動、熱量、食物、食譜等信息；\n- 數據兼容：支持與MyFitnessPal，Fitbit等運動軟件和跑步軟件的數據兼容；支持與小米運動、華為運動等手錶和手環廠商的數據兼容；\n- 同步經期：支持與美柚、大姨媽等月經記錄軟件的數據兼容，智能分析女性生理期不同階段的體重變化特點，個性化飲食和營養推薦；\n- Apple Watch：支持蘋果手錶，貼心小組件。\n\n科普內容\n- 淺顯易懂的科普文章向您介紹間歇性斷食的相關知識，指導您如何選擇正確的食物，控制飲食。\n- 教你如何計算卡路里，食物熱量與日常飲食中的熱量，比哥本哈根和生酮減肥更高效。\n\n斷食統計\n- 可視化您的斷食過程並跟踪斷食和體重的每日變化；\n- 分析統計數據，揭示斷食過程中身體不同的模式；\n- 智能提醒：完成每一個小目標，從而達到你的大目標。\n\n免責聲明\n間歇性斷食是飲食習慣的改變，不適用於孕婦/哺乳期婦女、18歲以下兒童或被診斷為飲食失調的人。請在使用前諮詢你的醫生或醫療保健專業人員。\n\n*使用效果因人而異，APP中給出的意見和證明無法涵蓋所有典型結果。\n\n健康應用集成:\nFemometer Fasting - 此App與Apple Health App集成，因此您可以同步您的數據（需要 iOS 9 及更高版本）。 Femometer Fasting 還支持Face ID以確保安全。\n\n訂閱政策\n在輕斷食APP應用內成功訂閱，即獲得所有功能和個性化斷食計劃，包括飲食營養建議與指南。\n計劃：每周$6.99，季度$19.99\n付款：確認購買後，應付款將從您的蘋果賬戶中扣除\n取消：在您的蘋果帳戶-設置中操作\n續訂：在現有訂閱期限結束前24小時，帳戶將收取續訂費用\n\n\n條款和政策\n隱私:https://s.bongmi.cn/miscs/fasting-app/en/privacy.html\n服務:https://s.bongmi.cn/miscs/fasting-app/en/service.html",

It kinda tricks ya and then is like peekaboo! It gets ur eye and then ask for something in return! Funny 😆",

I originally deleted the app because there was no way to UPDATE my weight or restart my fasting journey after stepping away for a while. I wanted all of the history deleted! Now I am signed up for a 3 month service paid through iPhone app, and I have no way of logging in to my account! I know they didn’t ask for my phone number or email when I originally signed up because they just ask you to pay!",

I know it says can lose 3.3/week but everyone’s body is different, it can definitely plateau but I for sure noticed while the scale wasn’t changing that I lost so many inches and my stomach definitely keeps going down almost by the day it seems. Also I researched that gaining muscle while losing weight can cause a plateau on the scale as well, I exercise at home for about 20 mins daily. I’m smaller than I’ve ever been since like 5 years ago. I know I will for sure meet my goal of losing 60 lbs. I thank God this ad crossed my path",

It doesn’t have a day count down instead of telling you we’re it’s going to be which is very helpful and is the whole Point but I would want it to say and and ex: 4 days till period starts and I just can’t seem to find and app that dose that. Number 2 adds keep popping up on getting premium I get that u guys want money and all but who want to pay money to keep track of there period. Overall I think is a good app but could be better so 4 out of 5.",

I love how reliable it is. I can always count on this to help me plan around my periods since mine are so painful. I can actually prepare myself ahead of time or make sure I’m not overwhelming myself the week of my period. I can’t recommend this enough.",

Unless you’re willing to pay for an a subscription.\n\nAt least offer people the option to pay a one time $3-6 for access to the app and all the exercises without all the “coaching” stuff.",

I know all this, because the app used to provide a free thirty day plan that you could adjust based on fitness level. Now it allows you to go through the lengthy tailoring process before asking for money. Same workouts, too much money.",

        "內容": "14 months of daily use, I think I can offer a credible review. I use this app with a Garmin Instinct 2s for tracking my running miles, weigh lifting, e-bike commuting, mountain biking, hiking, sleep habits, weight, HRV, and fitness goals. That’s a LOT for one app to handle, and it does so admirably. Super stable, zero crashes on my IPhone 15. The ‘glances’ (tiles) in the app on the home screen are wonderful, and I join one or two challenges every month. The training readiness is really helpful if you’re planning any races, and if you’re new to racing, the coached race guides in the app are fantastic with options for various distances (5k to Marathon). I find the points you can earn by completing challenges to be just difficult enough to keep me motivated without them taking over all other fitness goals. I also sync from the app to Strava, where my athletic “social life” lives. The app is deep, so it’s not the simplest to navigate, but that’s a trade off  I’m happy to make for the feature set. If you’re into data, the Garmin ecosystem is King and this app is a must. Can’t recommend this highly enough: whatever other app you are using on your phone, I can virtually guarantee it isn’t supporting your overall health the way this one will.",

Have been liking the watch itself - battery life, focus on fitness, etc. \n\nHowever, with all the data that Garmin collects, the app interface, UX, and analytics are pretty abysmal. \n\nWith Apple, the rings made it pretty easy to cycle through days and review progress for general movement and exercise. \nThere is no such thing for Garmin. All stats are completely silod, and can only be compared within that specific metric (like steps). \n\nIt’s not good looking - it’s not horribly ugly but you just get the feel looking at it and using it that it’s from 7-10 years ago. \n\nIn summery, this app could be SOOO much more. Garmin has had the lead on Apple and others when it comes to fitness capabilities, but every year Apple (and others) catch up by adding more features and analytics to their OS. If Garmin doesn’t take their software more seriously, I could definitely see them losing a good bulk of customers over frustrations and people going back to Apple, Suunto, Coros, etc. \n\nI just invested heavily in this Garmin Watch however and would love to stay with Garmin for awhile - please listen to your customers and do yourselves the biggest favor by trying to close the gap between your software and amazing hardware.",

Here is the scam part and I hope EVERYONE READS THIS. Even when you sign up through the phone, to cancel be sure you CANCEL ON THEIR WEBSITE AS WELL. Their cop out is that canceling on the phone isn’t good enough. Even though you may only use the app version, may only interact with this scam company through the app, and cancel through the app. THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO KEEP YOUR $38.99. So I’m warning you now, stay away or get one of the Super Mario Bros to help you out.",

Then there are times that it lags really bad. Luckily you can edit your times. Every year the price has gone up. This year the price has gone up by double!! So I was paying $39.99 and now it’s going to $89.99. That’s a hard pass. Why have such an increase? There is literally no upkeep for this app. I have never seen such a jump for an app. While I love using this app, I refuse to pay that amount of money. Especially in this economy.",

The ability to edit water after the fact because this doesn’t sync amongst the three devices adds to the annoyance. And sometimes the water “meter” does not rest to zero for new day or fasting period. Overall nice app but not worth the money I paid. I’d go freebie version instead. Finally, while I can edit windows, I’m noticing that accuracy is not consistent - reports streaks that are actually far longer than posted … that I find particularly irritating! I have to go in and edit or just accept it believes that I broke I fasting streak when I didn’t. Guess I’m learning not to care … watch out as when I’m at the point I don’t more often than do care - I won’t pay for this app any more.\nThen to see it’s doubled its price … absolutely not needed anymore!",

I paid for a 1-year subscription to this app, which seems ridiculous because I don’t understand why an app that simply tracks when I’m eating and fasting needs a recurring payment, but whatever. I paid for a year and then turned off auto-renew. It’s been about a week now and every time I open the app I get a pop-up asking me why I ended my subscription that won’t close until I select an answer. I’ve answered it like 5 times this week. Anytime I just want to start my fasting period I get grilled with the same pop up asking me the same question.",

When I check my dashboard tab (which is correct) it shows my progress from 4/25-5/3. This is skewing my shortest eating window to show 0.0 hours which is not correct.",

Being able to see WHAT is contributing to the AQI (PM2.5, O3, PM10, etc) is also useful for me. The Apple Watch complication works incredibly well!  The level of detail that has gone into this app is remarkable. The home screen widgets work really well too. You can stop looking, you’ve found the right AQI app.",

When I was in China and didn't know what air quality data to trust, I found that this one offered the most choices of data sources and was the most consistent with my personal experience of the air and my handheld air quality monitor. Also, it lets you visualize air quality over the last few days to see how bad (or good it's been) and even check air quality in different places to see which city you might want to move to (haha).

AQI’s used to be in small squares and literally covered my state (and others) with readings.   Now the AQI  readings are in circles, and there are only a few in my state, and they are in the same locations as US government / EPA sensors and they’re giving the same numbers as the EPA sensors.     Did AirMatters switch to using government sensor data (???), which I’ve found to be much less accurate.",

This time hitting the ‘+’ logged the reps instead of pointing me to the upgrade page and a video. I guess I hit a bug  the first time. \n\nI’ll keep trying out the app. Removing the star rating.\n\n*****************************\n\nThe free version is supposed to allow for limited logs. That limit is 0. I was trying the app for about 20 minutes. Created a workout, watched an ad EVERY TIME I went to create a missing exercise. They do have many built in, I just happened to have some they were missing like goblet squat or farmers carry. I created a workout. Added some exercises, then added my set/rep targets and went to log a set. Added my reps and weight and hit the plus sign to add it to the log. Instead of logging, it comes up with the option to buy premium so I hit the X, and it makes me watch a video. It won’t let me add the set to the log. Watched their videos on YouTube to make sure I wasn’t doing anything wrong. I wasn’t. You can’t log a set unless you sign up for the trial. The app should at least let you log a couple of sets without requiring a trial. The purpose of a free app is to give users a good experience and get them to want the premium. Seems the purpose of this app is to get ad revenue.",

My iPhone health app reads the right mileage and steps and the google fit app reads 1/2 a mile less and 2-3000 steps less every time.

The thing is that when I click that notification that the app itself sends me, the ad is now a black screen that doesn’t let me close it and I have to end up deleting the app. I hope there’s a better solution than deleting and reinstalling, though.",

However, the smart wake up seemed to always wake me up too early, whether using the microphone or accelerometer in the correct placement. This led to way more sleep inertia than desired.\nHere’s what feature I would add to greatly improve the app, and, if you added it I would be forever sold: a light alarm WITH a smart wake up, where the app would sense the lighter phase of sleep THEN turn on a gradually increasing backlight (and possible flashlight). It’s how our bodies are supposed to naturally wake up. No one else in the app market does this, and it would be super helpful.",

I should’ve did it for a month by month basis it started out beautiful but now it’s not doing anything last night  the app turned off all by itself sent me a message that I have to keep the app open which is ridiculous because it was open when I went to bed your not supposed to be on the phone at night I didn’t even get the message until I woke up in the morning. \n   I have the new iPhone 16 pro max which I keep up to date every month.

I can't believe I'm paying for this. \n\noriginal- I've loved this app for years! but recently started using it along with another app and it works fine until the first time it goes off. I snooze it and tab out of it for a minute to finish the other app and it cancels the alarm and goes to sleep notes. so now I have to use my phones built in alarm as a back up which I hate because there's barely any sounds. I might have to try other apps now to see if they're all incompatible with this other app or if it's just this one.",

No other sleep app needs to be told when I am going to sleep. It is supposed to wake you in the lightest phase of sleep during a timeframe. Not only did it fail to recognize a light sleep- I was awake and it didn’t go off. Instead it went off 17 minutes after my time range. The volume on the alarm ramps up way too fast. In about 5 seconds it’s very loud. You can’t tap a stop button to shut it up. You have to hold while it thinks. ‘Hold to stop’. I’m not trying to wake up the whole house! The wake up is jarring, not gentle. Here, let me wake you up late, require you to find your phone and hold for a few seconds while I ramp into concert level volumes. No TY. I should have stuck with the trial. Instead I tried a subscription. That was stupid.",

I’m only 4 months into the subscription and now the app doesn’t function.  I wish I could get a refund for the 8 months the app isn’t stable.",

The recorded sound in no way can determine if you’re in deep, light, or REM sleep. It’s a guess, and a joke. \n\n3. To start “tracking” your sleep, you MUST set an alarm. My internal clock wakes me up around 6 every morning. I don’t want to set an alarm, thank you. \n\n4. If your phone is on silent, the alarm does not go off. All alarm apps should still go off if the phone is on silent, come on. \n\n5. The music and sounds are a joke. Poor quality and awful sleep/meditation tracks.",

However, now it only reads well if it’s laying on my bed. But then my phone gets too hot and stops charging at 80%. But if I use the microphone option, it can’t read anything at all and says either I didn’t sleep or slept too deeply. I wish it went based off my Apple Watch rather than off my phone. Because that would give a more accurate accelerometer reading than sleeping with my phone under my pillow. I keep coming back to this app hoping things have changed and been updated to a useable place, but they just haven’t. I will sadly probably have to delete it again and maybe try again in a few years.",

Even today, on my day off, I managed to sleep 12 hours and it only counted 4. It's really frustrating and practically unusable, it feels like I'm being punished for getting the pgo plus.",

It often tracks my sleep in a weird way, sometimes recording more sleep than I actually got or missing parts of the night entirely. It’s frustrating because I was hoping for accurate sleep data, but instead I get inconsistent results. The gameplay aspect is cute, and I like the idea of connecting my sleep patterns to in-game rewards, but the tracking glitches really take away from the experience. Hopefully, future updates will fix these issues. For now, it’s a fun idea with a few kinks to work out.",

I am a Pokemon adult serving in my countries Navy. When I’m on duty on my boat, my phone doesn’t  get service. When I’m on deployment, my phone doesn’t get service. So i can’t connect to the internet during these times. \n\nOut of all of the pokemon mobile games, you’d think this one doesn't need internet, but it does. And it’s really disappointing because this game is a nice way to decompress. \n\nSure, I have my Switch games I can play in the evenings, but it’s the unique features that this game presents that are things I wish I had at sea.\n\nThese features include:\n-the sleep tracking. This is the whole point of this app. Sleeping well is an important concept when out at sea. With this app ive been able to identify things that help me sleep better.\n\n-this app helps me wake up on time. A lot of times i find it hard to wake up and go when my alarm goes off. With this app, i can set my alarm slightly earlier than when i need to wake up and doing all the tasks like studying the sleep styles, catching the pokemon, and feeding them breakfast, it helps me wake up. By the time I’m done doing all of the sleep research stuff, I’m good to get up and go.  But I can’t do any of this stuff out at sea because this app needs internet connection. \n\n-this app is also a good fidget app, if that makes sense. During the day, i like to open the app to feed the pokemon lunch and check out all of the tasks i need to do to evolve them, etc. \n\nAll in all, I really like this game, but because I cant use it when I’m out at sea, I loose incentive to play it when Im in port. It’s a good escape from the dull and dry world we live in, and it promotes healthy living, but i’m of a small percentage of people who are incapable of using it during specific periods of time. Because of this, there’s no reason i’d put money into this because, well, it’s unplayable for me. \n\nPlease consider making an offline mode. Just a mode where one could track sleep and do the most basic of tasks. \n\nThank you!",

Updates come weekly, sometimes even more frequently, and players are often treated to gifts from various events, which are frequent and engaging. Despite the barrier to entry for unlocking this game’s full potential being so high, given the price of the PGPP and the optional (but highly useful) monthly subscription service, the payoff is reasonable and results in more engaging gameplay—that is, transactions do not feel predatory.

However,  the simple fact that I have to press the sleep button every time I go to sleep is extremely inconvenient and almost destroys the app altogether because majority of the times I’m sleepy I do not remember that I have to press the sleep button, every time before I go to sleep. Which is slightly redundant / problematic because it gives us an option to let us know when to go to sleep. Assuming the sleep mode is triggered automatically.

It's incredibly frustrating for this app to promote positivity and good sleep while at the same time making you rush through the morning while you're already so busy for completely arbitrary and aesthetic reasons, punishing you for getting the new sleep style dex entries you want with more time wasted as the clock ticks. A speed up or skip-to-next-section button would make everything so much better. I wasn't even aware of the 'review later' option because of the hard-instilled habit of the app making me go through things as fast as possible, and even then, if you miss the button once, you're forced to go through it all anyway. Making it a toggle option to review later on default would better the experience significantly.",

For instance. Christmas Eve, I woke up about 11 times to pee (I know trust me ridiculous… was not happy lol) and am a guest at my parents and sleeping in the living room, my dad is a night owl. He didn’t go to bed till after 6 am but before I woke up for the last time at 7:15 am because he was up watching tv in the living room. So as a result my watch thinks I slept less than 90 minutes last night because of the noise and bathroom use. I fell asleep around 11pm and woke up at 7:15 am. Take out at most and hour and a half for going pee and that’s still well over 6 hours of sleep. Again I know that the tracking issue lies with the watch, but how come I can’t adjust it in app and still have my encounters?",

        "內容": "The game is fun and all, but every time I’ve tried to transfer my sleep data from my Apple health or from my watch or use my watch instead of the tracking on the phone it just doesn’t work. I’ve tried not turning the sleep mode on in the app and just tracking my sleep with my watch and transferring it over doesn’t work. I’ve tried to track both at the same time and then transferred over it doesn’t work. My problem is I charge my phone on a standing charger because I wouldn’t want to have my phone laying right next to me on my bed where I could toss it off the bed while I’m sleeping. Not to mention it would be in the way of my sleep so the only way to accurately track your sleep is with the app your phone laying on the bed. I don’t get it. It says it allows your smart watch to track your sleep, but it doesn’t pull the data over so I don’t understand what the point of it is to have it connected to the app.",

I love how there are for different exercise modes, and how each workout is only around 10-15 minutes. I love how these are workouts that you don’t need equipment to use. I also like that in each workout you get a repeat. For example, at the beginning you might do 16 fire hydrants, and then. At the end, you will do 14. I love how it repeats the exercise halfway through, so you can get better at the exercise, and work that muscle another time during the workout. I also love that in each workout, part of it is 1 minute and 30 seconds of cooling down. (Knee to chest stretch, adductor stretch, etc.)   It is also super helpful that they have the animation of the person doing the workout, and they offer videos of each exercise, which is a super time saver when your heart rate is up and you don’t want to look on youtube for a video of that exercise! Overall this app is amazing!! Thank you so much!",

I must say, though that I am foundering and wandering around the site not knowing what to do except pick random workouts and start on them. There is no guidance about how I should go about losing the weight. No program per se to follow except doing the workouts. There are many available and I don’t know for sure which one I should be doing. Setting the limits. Is difficult because I’m not sure what they mean by beginner intermediate. Or advanced. I have been doing tai chi for seven years and the chai Chi out is very fundamental and far too easy. The chair yoga is nowhere near able to help me drop weight within the timeframe that they recommended. However, it may be too early to tell. It’s only been eight days. So I will continue to found her around and try to do workouts. There is no sequence of workouts that I can tell and I am hoping that they will become more difficult as time goes on. At this point, I’m not sure it was worth the investment. We’ll see.",

A lot of metrics are poorly explained or have figures that mean very little (i.e. poor graph labeling). There’s a big lack of customizability for watch faces (only allows pre-selected colors and metrics). Lacks integration with almost anything outside of Fitbit/Google so it falls behind in a lot of smartwatch comparisons. Is purposefully hard to integrate with things like Apple Health or any other health apps. Lots of syncing issues. The social feature is kind of terrible because you can only share a few metrics and that’s only if you fully integrate your Google account (which most of my older family members will never do).\nThe biggest upside is it gives me peace of mind for health conditions like afib, insight on training intensity, and monitoring my sleep.\n\nFitbit could be great if they actually tried, but they seem to have settled for mediocrity.",

        "內容": "Update:  After 6 years of loving my Fitbit Versa and NEVER taking it off, they released an update that ruined it entirely. I held out hope for several weeks that they would put it back the way it was… but clearly from the feedback and responses here, they are not going to fix it. It’s ruined and useless. I uninstalled the app. The Fitbit is thrown in the back of a drawer, untouched since Novemember 2024. I’m researching other options for tracking exercise, sleep, calories… because Fitbit app literally no longer DOES ANY OF THOSE THINGS! I’m not sure why they decided to make all of the wonderful, helpful features useless but that’s what they did. It is a real shame and makes me very sad but I’m moving on. Not worrying about this stupid app ever again.\n\nDevelopers, is it going to stay awful and unusable, or is there a plan to put it back the way it was before the recent updates? Just revert back to the version from spring and it will be fine again. Otherwise it’s useless to even wear a Fitbit. Doesn’t record anything, can’t even see the data on the app, it’s just jumbled, monochromatic trash. Sleep no longer records anything. No steps are ever tracked. Useless garbage since the update. Prior to this, I never took it off since 2019 and I depended on it and loved it. It’s now in a drawer waiting to see if you revert back to previous version or not. Why did you do this to a perfect app? \n\n Update… I keep checking to see if it looks like they have fixed it, and I can see from the continuing awful reviews that it has not been fixed. I guess it is going to stay broken forever? They are trying to drive us all to buy a Google watch? I will not. Google sabotaged Fitbit when they bought it.",

I do miss some old features, specifically the color coding for calorie burn. Seeing the yellow, orange and green really helped with a snap shot of my workouts and motivation. I wish they’d bring that back.",

We tried for hours to sync it to the app and couldn’t even sign in.  Went on message boards went to Best Buy for help- when 2 Geeks can’t help and 2 Best Buy employees can’t figure it out you know it’s bad.  It appears when google bought them they took it and made it super complicated.  Trying to deal with google support was ridiculous and not worth the time for a simple pedometer.   So we returned  the Fitbit and will just go with an Apple Watch.  Super disappointed!",

It costs less to maintain an existing UI than it does to completely redo everything (I’m a UX designer, I would know) and the new one is objectively BAD, so I’m truly truly baffled. It looks like they fired their UX team and had a dev team do design work instead. Like what’s with all the buttons having double padding? Why is the padding so huge? Why are the buttons frequently touching/overlapping each other? Why is everything so GRAY?\n\nI’m seriously considering moving to a different fitness tracker company, maybe Garmin? after my current Inspire 3 gives out. Which is bound to happen soon enough in my experience, because I had two Luxe’s die on me in almost 3 years.\n\nI really really loved their old UI. I miss the vibrant colors and the cute illustrations of the sun and moon for sleep tracking. I miss how much easier it was to read everything and understand the charts and graphs. I miss the visual affordances each item on a page had. It’s been months since I foolishly updated my app and I’m still kicking myself. So it’s not even that I didn’t give myself time to acclimate. I hate it. Hate it hate it hate it. If there’s any way whatsoever to bring it back, please please for the love of god do so.",

There are a few other annoyances but these are the biggest frustrations. \n\nNot a fan of the latest updates as it’s more cumbersome to see the same data over time. For example, I used to be able to scroll through heart rate and sleep  over a month/year rather than by week only.

It’s a constant shower of negativity that bounces literally back and forth with no idea why I’m suddenly supposed to take the day off after the day before being told I hadn’t done enough. Why are we made to click these warnings closed to get rid of them? Why can’t we shut this off??  I cant figure out what the difference between cardiac load and zone minutes is anyway. I’m really annoyed that my happy place has become a nightmare of constant shaming me.",

        "內容": "First of all let me say I’ve written about 3 app reviews in my lifetime to include this one; but I really felt it was necessary to let everyone know this is the REAL DEAL. There’s no pressure, the exercises don’t leave you embarrassed (if you’re completely honest at the beginning about your workout level), and you can literally do it ANYWHERE. I’m in the military, and people assume that automatically causes you to be fit for some reason. Gravity affects us the same way! Lol I used to be a toned 140-145, had a baby and became a balloon— peaked at 205 (I’m 5’2). Became extremely unmotivated 24/8 first time mom. Not to mention working out was not happening (regrettably) during pregnancy at all. I was a cliche and signed up on the 1st of January... and I’m still going hard !! It was rough at first, but it felt good! And as the time passed and I started communicating with the feedbacks on the workout it just got better from there. I feel amazing. I’m not really seeing all the results just yet, but I’m only like 18 workouts in. I could go to the gym for free, but I’d rather pay for this any Day..I can literally workout on my on time and still be at home with my little babe, with pants or not! It’s amazing... I do the workouts in my office when I need a pick me up, and sometimes get my coworkers to join in! Go for the trial and you won’t regret it!! Thank you guys for EVERYTHING! Can’t wait to see my summer results!",

To my delight it was very similar to how I remember it being. Just timed out exercise, with example of ‘good form’ for each exercise. Perfect. Simple always works best, and will always be easiest to stick to. 5 stars then. Still 5 stars.",

        "內容": "After an accident in 2019, I was sent down a different career path where I wasn’t nearly as active anymore. I was fearful after hearing doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and pain management specialists all tell me not to do anything or I could be paralyzed. I didn’t feel as bad as they said I was, but listened out of fear. I went from 170ish to 190+ in about 5 years and I felt disgusting. Years after the injury, I decided to start walking. I’d stretch beforehand. Walking led to jogging. Jogging is pretty jarring, so I got this app, hoping to add core strength to support my lumbar. I bought a Maxtrainer to reduce impact on my discs. The combo has been great! I’m not the type to stare in the mirror, but I’ve noticed here and there I’ve got veins starting to pop here and there that I haven’t seen in years! I’m not looking to get jacked, just rewind to years of a more active life with a fit body. This app has done this and more! It doesn’t get boring, and it’s highly adjustable to meet needs, even on a daily to day basis. If I’m hurting or sore I can reduce the exercise time, choose back injury or shoulder injury to tailor workouts to my needs. I can even swap specific exercises on the fly if it hurts! My only complaints are, sometimes it doesn’t recognize that I just did a workout. Not a big deal, but it’s nice to see my workout count go from 211 to 212 etc. It’s frustrating to put in a 15-20 minute workout and see the counter hadn’t moved and it still shows the “start” button (like I haven’t done it yet). Another complaint is I’d really like to have an option to have favorites, when you do a daily set of exercises that just hurts good, it’d be great to be able to repeat that later if you wanted, as opposed to never seeing that combination of exercises together in a daily workout again. Overall, VERY pleased, I feel much better! I don’t feel like a washed up, broken veteran anymore. I feel like I’ve regained some discipline to look like I could still hop back in formation and show the new recruits that age doesn’t mean you can’t still be a weapon!",

        "內容": "Let me start by saying I am a woman and apparently that makes a huge difference when using this app. I started working out with my brother about 7 months ago. We go to the gym about 5 times a week. My brother uses this app when we go and he is able to select our target areas for that day and create a custom gym workout. Our work schedules recently changed and we are unable to go together now. Now that I go to the gym by myself I decided to download the app and paid for a one year subscription since I always like the workouts on the app. Well I put my personal details in and tried to create a custom workout and was caught by surprise when I realized it does not give an option for gym workouts. I thought maybe I did something wrong and asked my brother for help but he was unable to find an option for gym workouts as well. That is until we change my personal details and selected male instead of female. The gym option is only available if you have the settings set to male. Also on the female setting under equipment it only has 26 options (no gym equipment) but on the male settings it gives 64 options (including gym equipment). Had I known this app was more targeted towards men I would have downloaded a different app. Women go to the gym too. I pay for a gym membership and I should be able to put in my CORRECT personal details and goals and get proper GYM workout.",

Lame events, nobody wants an average pokemon because you put a hat and maybe glasses on it. It can’t even evolve now thanks to your  accessories. Pvp is a huge yawn with zero variety and beating team Rocket leaders rewards you with a chance to catch the lamest Pokémon 👎. Remember when getting your 7 day rewards meant a chance at Legendary?

I am a farmer, so I’m welding, grinding, driving tractors, all kinds of noise around me and I know I don’t have perfect hearing.

I received an auto reply saying customer support was busy and would get back to me on my email, as well as a separate “sorry to see you go” message. I’ve seen no response to my request for a refund, and I’ve sent another message, and still 12 days later no response. Since this app is not through Apple, but directly with Fit Coach, you have no assistance with customer service nonresponsiveness, or issues with integrity of fair business practices. My lesson is you should be wary with allowing this Fit Coach business to process your money based on my experience.",

        "內容": "This is a very difficult app to cancel. This is the second time that I tried to cancel this subscription from within the app. It automatically renews without any advice! \n\n Bait and switch - you will pay more than the promo, as the app doesn’t let you cancel until after the promo expired and it renews at least once!!!!!! They say that all of the info is in their terms… BUT THESE TERMS DO NOT APPEAR UNTIL AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE PROMO went through, AND CANCELLATION’s BUTTON IS GREYED OUT- so no cancellation until AFTER the second payment is extracted from you.\n\nThe phone number attached to this company never goes through. The support email did not answer when I stated that I had already canceled. \n\n I will be complaining to Apple and any other service due to BAIT AND SWITCH MARKETING TACTICS. No way to contact customer service as of yet (more than 3 months). The excercises I purchased were supposed to be Pilates but they were exercises on a chair for a grandma. There were nothing like wall Pilates or barre ballet exercises. Again: The promo does NOT allow the CANCELLATION BUTTON to activate UNTIL THEY CHARGE THE ADDITIONAL 66.65 dollars!!!! Be AWERE!!! The app cancelation button DOES NOT WORK. Moreover: There is NO WAY this app has 4.7 stars without BOTS!!! I went one by one through all the reviews NOW! And 98% of the helpful reviews were ALL 1 stars!! This definitely needs to be reported up to Apple and Samsung companies to be deleted and investigated further.",

VO2 max. 6. There is option to add note to any value eg. Abnormally high blood pressure because I ate salty meal. 7. When I disconnected my watch from BT from the phone my watch date was completely erased ie. it should have been back synchronized from my phone. 8 synchronization takes ages. 9. There is no way to offset or adjust blood measurements. The watch appears to be -5 points incorrect. 10. The Exercises in the app seem to have 4 randomly chosen exercises and nothing more. Not sure why, if my watch has 90.",

When I downloaded it again I found that there were quite a few more features that could be used but you had to pay a monthly subscription, it’s only like 0.54 cents a month and the added features help track not just your weight but how much your losing in different parts of your body (body composition) and you can look at different charts to see your progress. I love it. There’s no annoying ads, they don’t try to get you to download other apps, nothing annoying about it really and it’s super cheep.",

I think that it should also include good habits and exercising as a goal. When it is all about the weight, you’re never going to be happy. \n\nAnother suggestion is to make the weight goal as a range, since you won’t stay the same weight forever (due to water weight) For example, you can choose a range between 5 pounds. Then your goal is to stay within the range. \n\nBut this app has a good setup and it is very easy to use.",

Not a big revelation admittedly, but when you see how your behavior drives your results you can make the necessary changes and stay consistent which is key no matter what weight loss philosophy you subscribe to.  Of course, you could do all this yourself, but the app is free, convenient and just what I needed",

        "內容": "When I first started using this app, it was amazing. It actually recorded when I would sleep and listen to the deep/light sleep periods. \n\nSomething happened one day when it updated and it never worked the same. If I remember correctly, it was related to the iOS restrictions to curb apps monitoring you all the time. So I believe they were forced to change the algorithm to checking in periodically rather than constantly. \n\nThis led to a less desirable tracking. While although that was great at the time, what I love is the alarm. \n\nYou set your window, mine is 30 minutes. And if I set my alarm at 7, it could wake me up anywhere between 630 and 730. It tries to listen more during that time and if I stir, it’ll play the gradual melody to wake me up. \n\nWhat gets people is the snooze. Shake the thing and it’ll snooze. There’s another parameter you can set to lower the snooze time and the amount of times you can snooze. If you say 10 mins, but say you can snooze 3 times, that’s 30 mins. My alarm would then max wake me up at 8 by my example. \n\nSo on average if I want to wake up around 7, I would set my alarm at around 6:10. \n\nIf you want a “hard wake up” like a normal alarm clock. This app is not for you.",

The buzzer wakes me up, I haven’t heard the alarm in years, but if it snoozed and I’m looking at something on my phone, when the alarm goes off again, (only buzzing, not audible yet) the volume jacks all the way up, regardless of what I’m doing.  Nothing like looking at a YouTube or TikTok and having the audio go from 15% to 100 instantly with no warning.  It’s ridiculous.  There’s one setting for alarm volume in the app, but it does nothing.  Anyway, it used to be an amazing app, now I’m looking for something better.",

There is lots of flashy “concept” content if you dig around but nothing that actually tells you how to use the bleeping thing. I downloaded it and it immediately decided I was trying to sleep... at 10 am. Now it’s 11:41 and it’s telling me my alarm is set for 6am. I don’t want to get up at 6 am. I can understand waking me up +/- 30 minutes from a time I set. Or after it’s done some machine learning of my sleep patterns. But it has literally only “known” for a few waking hours so why is it trying to force me awake with only six hours of sleep and one and a half hours before I normally get up!?!?",

There is one more amazing improvement can be done: please creat an app for Apple Watch to be able to place the charging phone at night far away from the head because any charging phone creates strong electro-magnetic field.

It’s usually 2 to 3 days off of when my actual period begins but I always continue to use it because I like to know about when my period is going to begin. However, I just tried to log into my account to back up my data, and for some reason the device, the app will not recognize either one of the only two email addresses I’ve ever had in my entire life. so although I can’t log into my own account, this app continues to collect my own personal data that they can do whatever they want to with apparently. I reached out to their customer service who was very unhelpful and just kept telling me to click forget password when I explain to them again that that will not work, because neither one of my email addresses is being recognized by their app. They got snippy with me and just told me the same thing again. I will not be using this app any longer, but I guess it doesn’t really matter because they’re still gonna be able to collect all my personal data. The only thing I know to do is to try to delete as much information as possible out of out of the account, so just be wary of using this app and know that, even though they say they are not going to sell it to third parties that doesn’t mean they won’t. I am a researcher in data privacy and I know that company say this all the time and it’s not true.",

I can easily see the times I’ve been on birth control with the emojis they have. The calendar is simple and easy to understand. You can track so many things, like mood, weight, pregnancy, medicines and other stuff, but I use it for tracking my period, birth control, and sex. It’s cool that you get a summary of your statistics, can get a download of the data or even send it via email. Very useful during visits during the gynecologist. I also like that it send push alerts to remind me when my period may come. I also feel very confident using it since I know my data is safe.",

The app helped me decided exactly what i wanted and its so easy to adjust the hair. I downloaded 3 other ones before this and it was all color on hair color which looks horrible. Im glad i found this one especially if i go dark its so hard to go back to blond without ruining the hair. \nThank you for an awesome app",

This one doesn’t, but when you download it and fill out the questionnaire like “gender, age, height, current weight, etc” it takes you immediately to a screen for your weight loss plan of which you have to buy. It would be nice to know I’d have to buy the plan before I’d downloaded the app. I’d recommend at least adding the “in app purchase” so people are aware they’d need to buy their plans.",

I use a different app for hydration logging, and this app can’t read hydration data from Apple Health, only write it. You can only choose 1 “problem area” of muscles for the workouts to focus on, which is an issue as I’m generally out of shape and need to work on all of my muscle groups, and don’t know when or if I should change my “problem area” in my personal settings.

And to say no, you have to press on the X feature on the top left corner. The problem is that it was difficult to find the X button. Believe me when I say that it was camouflaged. So after you say no, you are then presented with an option to try a 3 day free trial - which I also said no to. I had one purpose in mind when using this app and when I accessed the “what your future baby would look like” feature, I entered my photo and my significant other’s photo and then it insisted I pay and after saying no, still insisted on using the free trial. After saying no again, I was presented with an ad so I could use it for free. The ad doesn’t even play. So what’s the point of downloading this “free” app when you have no choice but to use a 3 day trial or pay weekly. The ads don’t even work so you can’t access anything THAT IS FREE. Do not download this app. Can’t even use it. Waste of time.",

When I first got it, it was the best, most of the workouts were free and I can credit this app for being the reason I started really liking core workouts. The only gripe I had with it was that annoying “3,2,1” but I just turned my volume off. Fast forward to February 2023, about 4 years later and and I update the app and come to realize 85% of the previously available workouts are now subscription only. I said it’s fine, there are still a few that are solid I’ll stick to them. Whatever. Then a few months later, it’s July and literally every single thing on the app is pay to play. Everything is subscription based. Just don’t make the app free to download at that point if to do anything you have to subscribe and at an unreasonably high cost might I add. Used to be a great app. Now it’s dead. I hope the owners/management of this take the subscription and shove it up theirs",

Then they downgraded the app to Abs ONLY. To charge people for different body parts. I call BS. Now even the abs app is not working properly, lots of bugs no support link, great job guys... Really!",

So you must make sophisticated clucking to make it right. Or you can’t create your own plans. It results in a black screen with no exit.\nIn other things - great app. \nAnd like all apps out there - you “pay to play”.",

It’s great, has great workout plans that you enroll in depending on time which I’m limited on, it can also add workout times to your calendar automatically when enrolling to remind you. Only problem I have is I have to download a different app to focus on different parts of the body, wish there was one p4p work out app that I coul subscribe to that could give me the options on plans I want to focus on depending on my body and it would be awesome if they had some yoga plans in there as well.  The videos are pretty simple and self explanatory and the platform is simple to use for the most part. But would love to have to subscribe to one p4p app with more workout varieties and yoga rather than having to download 4 different ones and subscribe to each. It’s too costly and inconvenient.",

        "內容": "I’ve been using this and other P4P apps regularly for over a year. They are FANTASTIC, and I was delighted to pay $10-$15 for lifetime access to each of them. I was talking them up to all my friends and family, and just at the time I went to install a few of them on my wife’s iPhone (she’d seen me doing some of the workouts and wanted to start on them too) I found that the company had eliminated the lifetime purchase option for selected apps in favor of a monthly subscription to all the apps that costs over $150 a year, which we can’t afford (you can get gym memberships for less). Although I understand the power of a subscription sales model from a revenue perspective, I question the wisdom of P4P’s move in this direction (despite Apple’s encouragement to its developers to go this route) because from a consumer perspective - in my view -the value is not there, and I truly hope it doesn’t backfire on them. Also I’m saddened by the move because it will limit the number of people who can benefit from P4P’s outstanding work. I remain hopeful that P4P will reinstate some type of lifetime purchase option.",

I don’t want my data in their cloud, why can’t it just work on my phone?  Also they “upgrade” the app about once per week which seems very sketchy.  So I’m skipping the app and using the $300 scale and manually entering the data into apple health.  I will also leave a review on Amazon so people will know before they drop $300 on the scale.  They should scrap this app and start over with something simple that just works.",

It also provides verbal instructions with each workout to help you adjust your form. I don’t like that you can’t mute the instructions. After you know what you’re doing, you should be able to just listen to music. However this isn’t the biggest deal. \n\nOn the down side, for the cost of the program, they don’t do many updates or support. I’ve had an issue with days repeating for over a year. I reached out a year ago and was told this was a known issue and they are fixing it with the next update. I reached out again today and got the same response. It doesn’t seem like they take any issues or bugs seriously and it really is annoying to repeat workouts when it’s not it’s intended purpose. \n\nOther than this issue, there could be improvements made on the app itself. Workouts completed don’t sync if you skip a day and or if you move ahead a day. \n\nEmail from support:\nThe issue you describe is already forwarded to our team and they are working hard to fix it in the upcoming update this week. It may take a bit of time for us to fix this, and we'd really appreciate it if you could give us this time. Stay tuned and don't miss it!",

Switches up so if your doing legs on mondays, chest on tuesdays, back on wednesdays, you can cycle thru this program different days for an amazing 12 week program and pump. Adjusting ur weights and keeping track of ur own progress should be easily included in the app, a space to jot down numbers that’s all that’s missing. But I love the programs. Don’t cheat urself. Increase those weights weekly. Do about six programs each week (chest, legs, arms, back, core, shoulders) for 12 weeks, then you can do some of the others like at home, calisthenics, muscle building, fat burning, for additional weeks. It really gives you ah Years program you can cycle thru. Make the necessary changes to the weights and exercises pending on what you have at home, to change your body and life. 🫡✊🏿🔥",

Turn off notifications if you buy this app. I don't have access to a gym but on the very first workout they wanted me to have weights. There is no way to turn off equipment in the settings. Regardless the exercises are easy to follow. Food planning is not included in the basic app but there is a giant button for it on the homepage. This company has really aggressive ads and lots of them but really it's like the Temu of fitness apps all looks and once they have your money they don't care. Not worth the cost. Especially since the homepage has graphics that look like erotic cartoons. Not a serious company. Try another company.",

I specified that I was doing the exercises at home, and it keeps wanting me to use machines that you would only have at a gym.  When I reached out to support, they just said to “scroll” past those and find ones that would work.  So how is this structured?  You set up goals in the very beginning with weight loss, but you get to pick and choose what you do?  Not sure how this is supposed to work.  And don’t even think they will stand behind it and give your money back.  That is not going to happen.",

Of course, you don’t find out any of that out until after you subscribe. Oh, the nutrition plan also costs extra. If you go through this process on the website instead of the app, the price is different, FYI. Buyer beware. For what you pay for, you can find all these workouts on the internet for free.",

There is no adaptation to how well you completed one to the next. Oh finished you 10 push ups on a Monday? Tuesday let’s do one handed clap push ups 🙄.\n\nI did not get a trial.

I’ve walked for so long!!!” Then I find out, you can’t use it, even tho iPhone is like the main apple device for walking, plus watch is impossible to type so I can’t find stuff on it, so iPhone is best for it!

It’d be great if I could filter the videos I’ve done from most watched to least. It’d be great if I could fast forward/rewind, especially when it randomly glitches and it’s in the middle of a set overall, the workouts are good but the app is trash. Not worth the single price.

Took nearly 90 minutes to stop sweating and cool down. So yeah, I KNOW I should have logged at least 20 minutes of exercise. I used to have a fitbit before this and I hate to say it (not really), but the app for fitbit was nearly 100% customizable (not to mention a 100% complete app). This is my first Apple Watch (9 series) & it’s cute I guess, but for the price I find it excessively restrictive & expensive to buy all the apps necessary to customize things correctly.\nThis particular app is useless for anything aside from a step tracker.

The numbers they give based on weighing oneself on said scale are questionable at best, I would love to see the scientific algorithms are using to determine some of these claims. It’s sad, because this has a significant amount of potential. If there were actual science behind their numbers and the app itself wasn’t so buggy I’d consider subscribing but as it stands now the only thing that I care about is the rest of the numbers I can do myself. so if you’re buying one of these inexpensive scales, do not expect the world from the app, it’s what we get in today’s world.",

It is a string of Bebird Note 5  refusing to connect to either my iPhone 15 Pro Max or my 6th Gen iPad Pro 12.9”, or when connected, constant drop-outs or disconnects while the device is in the ear canal. I cannot tell if it is the Note 5 or the Apple device initiating those issues. \nWhen it works it works great. But, it is not working the majority of time. I cannot have the screen go black when using! \nAgain, this appears to started happening at some point after upgrading to iOS and iPadOS 17 and has gotten worse under 18 (currently on 18.2).\nOne other improvement to consider is allowing the app on either device to go to landscape when rotated.",

        "內容": "I prefer to use this on iPad since it has a bigger screen and won’t complain about “no internet, switch to cellular data” like my iPhone does. The problem is this app does not seem to support landscape mode. I always have to rotate my iPad from landscape to vertical and then back to landscape to get the image to rotate and that can only be done from within the camera view, not the Home Screen. If they allowed the Home Screen to be landscape this would fix that issue. The other problem I have is the image is always mirrored/reversed. I have to tap the ear icon to flip it and then it’s correct but it never remembers this setting. It also never remembers the camera brightness setting. Please allow these settings to be saved rather then being reverted each time. If these three things could be fixed then the app would be 5 stars. As for the product, it works well and I recommend it but I wish they made the tips smaller. Even the smallest blue rubber scoop is too big. A smaller one would make the job easier.\n\nAugust 2024 update: the latest version of the app is even worse then before. The app doesn’t work in landscape at all. The settings have completely disappeared. The camera is super laggy and choppy when I never had that issue before and you can’t even see the percentage of the battery anymore. I’m so frustrated with this downgrade I’m about to throw it out and find something from a different brand.",

The work around is connect using your girl’s phone and have her leave it in her pocket. She has to send the remote request to you and then she has to keep the app open for it to work. The last issue is battery life because you might get 30-45 minutes of full power play time but it takes about 4 hours I believe to recharge.\n\nNow the good: when you do the workaround I said above it works great and it’s incredibly hot watching her squirm in public from a few flicks of your fingers, listening to her whine about being so close and beg for you to push her over the edge. So in regards to it being quiet and effective it’s perfect.\n\nFor this review me and my girl used the Mr. Devil version 1",

I find it interesting.\n\nI give it four stars for its spelling and grammar mistakes on the facts. Also due to the fact it's hard to correct a date entered for your menstration cycle if a few days have gone by.\n\nHowever, I do recommend this app for those who want a simple calendar!",
